  Over the last months we focused on releases of icons and themes, so we thought
  that it may be useful to release **Photoshop brushes and vector graphics** for
  a change. Hence, in this post we release a set of Photoshop brushes for space
  effects, a set of brushes to simulate the effect of a painted canvas, a
  hand-drawn vector illustration set and a Moleskine icon set.

  You can use the sets (except the bonus set) for all of your projects for
  **free and without any restrictions**. You can freely use it for both your
  private and commercial projects, including software, online services,
  templates and themes. The set may not be resold, sublicensed, rented,
  transferred or otherwise made available for use. Please link to this article
  if you would like to spread the word.

## Messy Watercolor Photoshop Brushes Set

In the past we have featured <a href="https://www.fudgegraphics.com/">Franz Jeitz</a>'s work already (he designed a couple of desktop wallpapers for us) and the response from our community was really great. So when Franz suggested to do something together we were quick to respond. The result is a set of Messy Watercolor Photoshop Brushes, released exclusively via Smashing Magazine.

{{% feature-panel %}}

The set has 12 brushes at a resolution of 2300px which results in an .abr file of the size 27.3Mb.

### Behind the design

Here are some insights from Franz himself:
<blockquote>"Like many people I have an ever-growing library of photoshop brushes. My all-time favourites are those that have a grunge feeling to them. At first I only collected high resolution photoshop brushes, but ever since I started my own design blog at <a href="https://www.fudgegraphics.com">www.fudgegraphics.com</a> I made my own and shared them with the design community. So it is my pleasure to release the "Messy Watercolour Brushes 1" exclusively on Smashing Magazine.

The set includes 12 brushes ranging from 2156px up to 2294px. I suggest experimenting with the brushes to discover the full potential of this set . Open a blank canvas and start painting on individual layers. Play with colours and blending modes until you're happy with the result. What I like most about watercolour brushes is the endless opportunities. You could complete a design using only the brushes. Or you could overlay them on text or vectors to give them a more organic feel. You may even combine them with different gradients. Whatever you do I hope you have fun with them. For more Hi-Res photoshop brushes please visit the <a href="https://www.fudgegraphics.com/category/freebies/">Freebies Section</a> on fudgegraphics.com.

Unfortunately people stuck on Photoshop versions prior to CS1 won't be able to use these brushes as they are simply too large. Don't worry though. The source files used to make them will be released shortly on Smashing Magazine as a texture pack."</blockquote>

## Painted Canvas Brush Set

In Photoshop there are several ways to simulate a painted canvas look in your designs either using textures or filters but neither of those methods are good at simulating the brush strokes created when an actual paint brush hits the canvas. The Painted Canvas Brush Set contains <strong>55 high resolution Photoshop Brushes</strong>. Each brush was created specifically to simulate the effect of a painted canvas and each brush can be used in several ways.
