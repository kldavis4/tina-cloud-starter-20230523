  Sometimes things evolve faster than you think. Something that started as a
  simple WordPress blog back in September 2006, has evolved into a little
  Smashing universe — with books, eBooks, conferences, workshops, consultancy,
  job board and, most recently, [56 fancy
  cats](https://staging.smashingmagazine.com/) (upcoming, also known as
  _Smashing Membership_).

  We have a wonderful team making it all happen, but **every project requires
  attention and focus** and every project desperately needs time to evolve and
  flourish and improve.

After more than 11 years of being editor-in-chief at Smashing Magazine, I’ve been struggling a lot to find that perfect balance between all of our projects, often focusing on exciting ideas and neglecting good old ones. I would jump to writing, or teaching, or coding, or designing, or working with conference speakers, instead of reviewing and editing articles, often leaving Smashing Magazine running on the side.

**It’s time for a change.** It's not an easy decision for me to make, but I sincerely believe that it's an important one. Smashing Magazine has been the heart of everything we've been working on throughout all this time, and with many new Smashing adventures scheduled for 2018, it deserves a stronger focus and support: a guidance stronger than the one I was providing throughout the last years. Most importantly, it needs much more care and attention.

With this in mind, **I can’t be more happy and honored** to welcome the one-and-only _Rachel Andrew_ (yep, you got it right) as the **new editor-in-chief** of Smashing Magazine. Rachel will be helping us bring the focus back to the core of this little Smashing universe — this very magazine that you are reading right now. Rachel doesn’t really need an introduction, and her work for the community speaks for herself. There is one thing worth mentioning though: with Rachel, I'm happy to have a reliable and extremely knowledgeable editor on our side, the one I could only dream of. I’m not going anywhere, of course, but I’ll be spending more time writing and teaching and working on other Smashing projects instead. This is Rachel’s spot to take now.</p>
