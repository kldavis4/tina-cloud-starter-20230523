### Behind the design

As always, here are some insights from the designers:

<blockquote><p>"We created the original CSS Help Sheet because we spent ages staring at ugly cheat sheets while designing beautiful sites. So we thought we'd make a Help Sheet that didn't hurt the  eyes of anyone who tried to use it. The past year, we've found ourselves using more and more CSS3 methods, and there was never much in the way of help out there until we decided to create a Help Sheet specifically for CSS3.</p> 
<p>We've kept CSS2 and CSS3 on separate Help Sheets for now as not everything in CSS3 is finalised, or works in all browsers (cough, IE).</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy using them, and that they help you create even more memorable, usable, and stylish websites.</p>
</blockquote>

Thank you, guys. We really appreciate your work and your good intentions.</p>
