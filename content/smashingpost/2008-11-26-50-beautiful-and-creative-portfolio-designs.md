Design portfolios come in various forms. Traditionally, they have been print-based and something you would carry to a client pitch or meeting to showcase <strong>what you’ve done</strong> and <strong>how you did it</strong>. Today, many designers take advantage of the Internet to publish and showcase their work via their online portfolios. Having your work displayed online removes the geographical restraints that traditional portfolios impose on you. 

With many portfolios online, it’s often hard to stand out from the sea of competition out there. It takes a creative design to grab the user’s attention long enough for him or her to enjoy sifting through your work. Adding rich interactive elements, framing your work in a unique way, and concocting a means of providing a unique experience can not only get the user’s attention but also show your capabilities as a designer.

In this showcase, you’ll find a variety of <strong>beautiful, unique and highly creative portfolio designs</strong>. The aim here is to stimulate your creativity and inspire you to create your own portfolio or re-think your existing one. You’ll see portfolios from a wide range of fields, including Web design, product design, illustration, photography and even animation.

## 50 Beautiful and Creative Portfolios

Pikaboo
This portfolio showcases a creative navigation scheme; use the scroll button on the mouse to navigate up and down the showcase. Alternatively, the designer gives you a columned view of the showcased work if you click on “Overview.”

Lyndon Wade
This portfolio effectively integrates the interface of the design. Clicking a category link of the portfolio expands a “film-strip” view of the thumbnails in the section. Upon clicking a thumbnail, it expands to a full-screen view; clicking on the left or right allows you to navigate through all of the showcased paragraphs in full-screen mode.

Jesse Willmon’s fall 2008 DESIGN-TACULAR
Jesse Willmon presents his portfolio in a unique fashion, through “doodles,” giving it a memorable user interface.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0365f1d1-0744-41e1-bfe0-a1e90e8becd4/03-jesse-willmon.jpg" alt="Jess Wilmon screen shot." width="550" height="350" />

Daniel Stenberg
Daniel Stenberg frames each of his works beautifully and allows users to navigate through them horizontally. The result is a clean and simple but effective portfolio design.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/60aedd31-08c0-4ca7-9757-9dafeda1d3c6/04-daniel-stenberg.jpg" alt="Daniel Stenberg screen shot" width="550" height="350" />

Domenico Tedone Design
Unconventional navigation schemes can be a great way to leave a lasting impression on users (but they can also make users <em>leave</em> in an instant); Domenico Tendone capitalizes on Flash’s strength of being responsive to user events by showcasing his work via a revolving 3-D wheel. Use the scroll button to scroll through his work.

Marc Dahmen
Marc Dahmen gives us a creative user interface by showing his projects as business cards. Clicking on a business card gives you a nifty animation as it enlarges. To make navigation easier, the portfolio provides keyboard shortcuts (you can see them at the top left of the page).

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/bfaa2902-b626-4fff-8ee7-c1988ae723fb/06-marc-dahmen.jpg" alt="Marc Dahmen screen shot." width="550" height="350" />

SuperLover
The excellent selection of colors in this portfolio complements the showcased artwork, and the organization of each piece makes it stand out.

Aline Caron Portfolio
The presentation of the thumbnails in this portfolio gives it a unique interface, reminiscent of the chemical table of elements.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d9d0e265-fdea-44d4-a047-c3548fde89f1/08-enila-fr.jpg" alt="Aline Caron Portfolio screens hot." width="550" height="350" />

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/47a215e9-6227-47cd-b9d6-8f9478d7969f/10-deep.jpg" alt="Deep screen shot." width="550" height="350" />

Booreiland
Booreiland’s portfolio gives users a “breadcrumb” navigation scheme so that they can easily jump through sections.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e6a55247-b0c6-4e83-8b12-4e7652f99e10/12-booreland.jpg" alt="Booreiland screen shot." width="550" height="350" />

In this showcase, the projects dominate the entire page, and a thumbnail gallery on the right-hand side gives you a way to browse through the projects.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7bb84a34-a142-4f8b-9f33-976d631c7064/13-vivified.jpg" alt="vivified screen shot." width="550" height="350" />

Rob Young
Rob Young frames his projects in a MacBook Pro laptop, alluding to the nature of his job as an art director and designer.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/1d145990-760b-4e95-9652-fade3760d744/15-robyoung.jpg" alt="Rob Young screen shot." width="550" height="350" />

Sid Lee
This clean and simple portfolio gives focus to the active work being viewed by allowing it to take up a large part of the viewing area. Hovering over the right-hand side of the page opens up an alternate navigation menu.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/801746e5-9f66-4133-85c9-746e82bd4359/16-sid-lee.jpg" alt="Sid Lee screens hot." width="550" height="350" />

Nile Inside
Artwork is displayed in a “film-strip” view, and clicking on a piece expands it without navigating away from the film strip. Even with the rich interactivity of the portfolio, it doesn’t rely on Flash.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2a206a8e-8350-4c60-bc48-ac0ec7deaa2e/17-nile-inside.jpg" alt="Nile Inside screen shot." width="550" height="350" />

Les illustrations de Lapin
Illustrations displayed side by side beautifully showcase the illustrations made in the artist’s sketchbook, giving the portfolio an unprocessed, raw, natural look.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/16a1b817-8c67-40c8-87cd-e5f52ebb2670/18-les-de-lapin.jpg" alt="Les illustrations de Lapin screen shot." width="550" height="350" />

Contrast
Conventional design portfolios are visual, but that isn’t the case with Contrast’s portfolio, which displays its “thumbnail” gallery in a text-based format.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/fc8668df-4cea-4ffa-84c3-4dbd3323a127/19-contrast.jpg" alt="Contrast screen shot." width="550" height="350" />

sroown
sroown effectively uses its logo to frame its design gallery. Note the red “Jump back to top” element along the right-hand side that follows you along as you scroll down the page, a subtle enhancement of the interface that gives you insight into the small details they pay attention to in their designs.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/04ce859e-ab3f-45ef-ba74-aaa2b649e1f5/20-sroown.jpg" alt="sroown screen shot." width="550" height="350" />

EveningLab
A creative interface makes EveningLab’s portfolio stand out.

Die Neue Modern
Irregular shapes and sizes of the thumbnails in this portfolio give it a unique and “systematic disorder.”

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/9e75d363-f41e-4608-8515-807ac0ce0c97/24-die-neue.jpg" alt="Die Neue Modern screenshot." width="550" height="350" />

Made Like Me
This portfolio shows the typical way of displaying thumbnail galleries; but by leveraging the artwork’s vivid colors and placing the art against a dark background, each piece pops out of the page and the gallery achieves a unified look.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e7ecc958-98c1-44a8-99ff-16d60059ba7a/25-madelikeme.jpg" alt="Made Like Me screen shot." width="550" height="350" />
