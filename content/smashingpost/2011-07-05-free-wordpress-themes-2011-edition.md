It’s interesting to look back at our <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/08/19/100-free-high-quality-wordpress-themes-for-2010/">previous</a> <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/05/18/100-amazing-free-wordpress-themes-for-2009/">WordPress</a> themes round-ups. It’s almost like looking at a visual timeline not only of WordPress’ advances in theme design, but of the rapid development in functionality of the CMS itself. The themes from year to year clearly differ in style as Web design trends have evolved. As each year passes and more functionality is added to WordPress’ core, these improvements are strongly reflected in the themes developed for it.

Once upon a time, all WordPress themes looked like traditional blogs, with basic functionality and not a heck of a lot more. But as you will see from the themes below, that original “blog” design style is clearly gone, perhaps never to be seen again. It makes you feel nostalgic.

{{% feature-panel %}}

Nowadays, **user requirements for WordPress themes are very high**. Users expect all themes (including free ones) to have pages for admin options built in, where you can quickly set up your website and personalize it with a minimum of fuss. With the rise of these options pages, niche-specific theme designs (such as for portfolios, blogs or magazines) are no longer required and are, in fact, few and far between.

Most of the themes below can be tailored via the options panel to be anything you want, whether a portfolio, a content-heavy magazine-style website or a basic blog. Setting one up takes only 10 minutes. This actually gave us a few problems when it came to categorizing the themes below. We spend a lot of time researching, collaborating on and writing these round-ups. In fact, it is a Smashing Magazine tradition to publish the top 100 WordPress themes from the previous 12 months (this is our fifth edition).

<a href="https://aarontgrogg.com/boilerplate/">Boilerplate: Starkers</a>  
This Boilerplate framework was developed by combining <a href="https://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a> and the bare-bones <a href="https://starkerstheme.com/">Starkers</a> into a minimally marked-up, HTML5-ready framework. The Boilerplate theme is designed to function as a parent theme to whatever child you would like to add. But you could just as easily use this as a starting point and alter the PHP as your design requires.

<a href="https://www.twentytenfive.com/">TwentyTen Five</a>  
TwentyTen Five was originally launched in the Smashing Magazine article “<a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/02/22/using-html5-to-transform-wordpress-twentyten-theme/">Using HTML5 to Transform WordPress’ TwentyTen Theme</a>.” It is basically an HTML5 upgrade of the default TwentyTen theme, and yet it is much more than that. With its support for brand new HTML5 elements and its compatibility with all modern browsers (although to use HTML5 with IE versions 6 to 8, you need a pinch of JavaScript, which is included), this theme is perfect as a development framework.

Constellation (Demo)  
This great starting point gives you the flexibility to provide bespoke styles for different devices, totally up-to-date HTML5 code (which is fantastic for SEO) and a flexible grid system, on top of all of the other goodness bundled in the HTML5 Boilerplate.

<a href="https://themble.com/bones/">Bones</a>  
This feature-rich bare-bones theme was built using some of HTML5 Boilerplate"s recommended mark-up. It also has a ton of features, such as page navigation, breadcrumbs, a widget for related posts, HTML5 video with fallback and a heck of a lot more. Bones was designed to make the developer"s life easier; it"s meant to be hacked until it fits what you"re looking for.

Skimpy  
Skimpy has basic WordPress 3.0 functionality, including custom menus, thumbnails and custom sidebars. A couple of other useful tweaks are commented out, but you can comment them in and do what you want with them. The only style included is a container that sets the width to 900 pixels.
