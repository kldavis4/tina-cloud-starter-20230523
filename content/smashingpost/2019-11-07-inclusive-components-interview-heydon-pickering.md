Accessibility can sometimes become an unfortunate afterthought as we race to meet deadlines and search for tips and tricks to meet client demands. We can cause problems for keyboard or screenreader users, and leave our products fragile and potentially vulnerable to legal action from people who find themselves locked out due to their accessibility needs. How can we get better?

One way to find out would be by joining our live stream with [Heydon Pickering](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/heydon-pickering/) who will be sharing insights about the relationship between accessibility and design systems, and exploring how to build accessible components, and why he decided to write a book on accessible interface design patterns.
