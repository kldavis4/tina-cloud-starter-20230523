With so much happening in front-end and UX these days, it can be quite difficult to keep track of important things. Luckily, there are wonderful newsletters and blogs out there that shed light on the latest in the web industry. In fact, with our <strong>weekly</strong> [Smashing Email Newsletter](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-smashing-newsletter/), we aim to achieve that as well.

Every week, we send out useful <strong>front-end & UX tips</strong>, techniques and tools to help you get better at your work. We couldn’t be more grateful for the trust of **190,000 designers and web developers** who are already subscribed. And if you aren’t yet, now there is a good reason to join in!
