  While there are a lot of beautiful and well-designed blogs out there, most of
  them use a single template for each of their blog posts. Today, I would like
  to showcase 20 extraordinary blogs with unique post designs.

  > "While, yes, this is a redesign of sorts, I’m considering much more a
  rethinking. You see, what you’re looking at isn’t the design so much as the
  plan for design." - Jason Santa Maria

  Looking at the designs of these sites will make us all rethink the way we
  design our blogs. **These designers have all managed to think outside the box
  in their designs.** Let's take a look at these 20 extraordinary blogs with
  unique post designs.

<div class="blue-line"></div>

## [David Desandro](https://desandro.com/)

David's blog is just phenomenal. You really need to visit his blog. By the way, that circle text on his blog is not made out of an image, it is in HTML. I didn't even know that was possible.

<img class="post-border" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/79345a3d-833f-483d-aeca-7523acbcb305/david-1.jpg" alt="David Desandro" width="600" height="437" />

## [ESPN Outside the Line](https://search.espn.go.com/e-ticket/e-tickets/12)

ESPN did a great job with these posts. I think they have over 100 different posts that are styled different. Great job, even better because it's about sports.
