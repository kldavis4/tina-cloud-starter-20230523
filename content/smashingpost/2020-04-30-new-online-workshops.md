It has been a month since we launched our first online workshop and, to be honest, we really didn’t know whether people would enjoy them &mdash; or if _we_ would enjoy running them. It was an experiment, but one we are so glad we jumped into!

I spoke about the experience of taking my workshop online on [a recent episode of the Smashing podcast](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/04/smashing-podcast-episode-14/). As a speaker, I had expected it to feel very much like I was presenting into the empty air, with no immediate feedback and expressions to work from. It turned out, however, that in some ways I felt more connected to the group by sharing my knowledge with a bunch of folks who were exactly in the same situation as me &mdash; at home trying to make the best of things!

I spoke to Vitaly about how he felt about leading a workshop online, and he also felt that everyone felt more equal, rather than having a teacher up on a podium. He also noted that we were able to see how global our audience is. <strong>Online workshops are more accessible</strong> to people who can’t travel even in normal times, and seeing everyone at home in their own environment really brought to life that we were working with folks from all around the world.

As a participant, there are definite advantages in attending a workshop from home. You have your own desk and usual setup, and space to spread out. And, given the workshop seating I’ve encountered in the past, most of you probably have a more comfortable chair. You can also <strong>rewatch the recording</strong> if you want to listen to an explanation again.

## All The Details

As we have now formalized our workshop process, I thought I’d share a little more about how these events run. Unlike in-person workshops where we keep you in a room for an eight hour day, we realized than many of you have a lot of other commitments right now. Perhaps you are also homeschooling your children, trying to keep up with work from home, and it’s hard to be sat in front of a screen working all day. So <strong>all of our workshops are split over multiple shorter sessions</strong>, so check each workshop description for the full details of days and times. We’ve had great feedback from attendees and speakers about this approach.

In addition to the presenter, there is always at least one other member of the team online, to help with any connectivity or other issues that you might have.

Even from home, the learning never stops. <a href="https://t.co/K3pbJBNpof">pic.twitter.com/K3pbJBNpof</a></p>&mdash; Gabriel Tan-Chen (@gabrieltanchen) <a href="https://twitter.com/gabrieltanchen/status/1250523153195040769?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 15, 2020</a></blockquote>

### Zoom

We’ve chosen Zoom because they turned out to be the best compromise in terms of quality, reliability, and accessibility. You can customize your Zoom setup that works best for you. You can resize the windows of the shared screen and the speaker. You can pop out the chat. Whatever works best for you!

We record each of the sessions for attendees, so if you do miss a session you can catch up later. Or you can go back to check out a detail you want to confirm.

### Chat and connect

You can also join us in Slack, to chat during or after the workshop with fellow attendees.

We have also been using <strong>collaborative Google docs</strong> during the workshops for attendees to write down their own thoughts, resources, tips, and questions. It’s interesting to see people helping each other in those docs as well as posting questions for the Q&amp;A.

A surprising thing for me about the online workshops was that I answered more questions than I do when I teach in-person. Each session has <strong>dedicated time for Q&amp;A</strong>, and I did not expect to be able to fill 30 minutes, but could have easily been answering questions for longer.
