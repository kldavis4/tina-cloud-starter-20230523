## Step One

Gather two high-quality images of the people that you want to blend. Remember to try to get these two images to look similar, as far as the person's face position is concerned. This will aid in making the final outcome look as real as possible.

<div class="blue-line"></div>

## Step Two

Copy one of the images and paste it into the other image. I copied the woman with blue eyes and pasted it into the other picture.

<div class="blue-line"></div>

## Step Three

Take the lasso tool and draw around the face that you want to apply into the other person's head.

Go to <strong>Select &gt; Modify &gt; Feather</strong> and put <strong>20 pixels</strong>.

Press <strong>Ctrl+J</strong> or <strong>Cmd+J</strong> to put this selection in its own layer. Delete the original layer where this face came from.

<div class="blue-line"></div>

## Step Four

Lower the opacity of this layer until you can slightly see the face below it. Transform and align the top face with the bottom face so that the two faces are aligned exactly. Bring the opacity back to 100% again.

<div class="blue-line"></div>

## Step Five

Take the eraser tool and with a soft brush, <strong>erase around the facial features</strong> (eyes, nose, mouth) so that it shows a little bit of the features of the bottom layer.

<div class="blue-line"></div>

## Step Six

Play around with the <strong>Levels</strong> settings, the <strong>Hue &amp; Saturation</strong> settings and the <strong>Color Balance</strong> settings until the color and lighting of the face matches the rest of the background.

It's that simple. There you have it, a new women in six easy steps. Below is my final result. Please note that it doesn't look perfect because I just did this tutorial quickly just to show you what is possible with Photoshop.
