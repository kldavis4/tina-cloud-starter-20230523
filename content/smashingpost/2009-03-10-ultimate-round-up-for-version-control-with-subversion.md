While other version control systems, like <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, have become quite popular among developers, Subversion (SVN) is still considered the standard for version control systems and is used for the majority of projects on the Web that need something like it. SVN provides the ability to share source code in a collaborative way, making it popular with teams for sharing and contributing to projects. It’s also a great choice for designers who want to keep versions of their personal work environments.

There are quite a few resources available for those who want to learn about SVN-like tools, tutorials and SVN clients, so that you can get started working with the popular version control system.

<a href="https://trac.edgewall.org/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c361077d-48e5-4ad7-a73e-3651075227ac/trac2.png" alt="Trac" width="380" height="109" /></a>
