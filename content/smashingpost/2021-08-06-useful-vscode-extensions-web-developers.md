## Inline Parameters

Which `param` is the array and which is the callback in PHP functions `array_map` and `array_filter`? I can never get it right. To avoid this confusion we can use [Inline Parameters](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=liamhammett.inline-parameters), which prints inline the names of the function parameters (for JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, and Lua).

## HTML End Tag Labels

With deeply nested `<div>` tags we can easily get lost, not knowing which is their ending `</div>`. [HTML End Tag Labels](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anteprimorac.html-end-tag-labels) helps us understand the structure of the HTML code, by having the class names of the opening tag be displayed next to its closing tag.

## TO-DO Tree

You have something to do in your code, but you don't have time for it now. Better do it later. Quick and easy reminder: add a "TODO" in your code. Fast forward 6 months, and you've accumulated 150 TODOs, and you need to take care of them. The [Todo Tree](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree) will help you find all TODOs in your code.

## Code Snippet Screenshots

You created some really beautiful code, and you want to share it with the world? You can take a screenshot, download it, go to Twitter, upload it and send it. Or you can select the code right within the editor, and have [Snipped](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JeffersonLicet.snipped) generate a beautiful image of it and send it straight to Twitter.

{{< rimg href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JeffersonLicet.snipped" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/bdda62e5-fe54-44eb-903b-c1c6771f34b1/4-useful-vscode-extensions-web-developers.png" width="800" height="388" sizes="100vw" caption="" alt="Code screenshot taken with the Snipped VSCode extension" >}}

These four extensions have proven very handy for my work with web development. What other useful extensions do you use? Let me know in the comments.
