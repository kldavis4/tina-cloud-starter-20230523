<p>Oh yes, the infamous <a href="/categories/mystery-riddles/">mystery riddles</a> are back! To celebrate the relaunch of this little website, we've prepared something special yet again — a <em>Smashing Emoji Mystery Riddle</em>. And this time, instead of scouting an answer in a physical place or on Twitter, it's well hidden somewhere on this website.</p>

## So, What Can You Win?

<p>Among the first readers who tweet <a href="https://www.twitter.com/smashingmag">@smashingmag</a> all the hidden emoji, we'll raffle a quite extraordinary, <em>smashing</em> prize (and a couple of other Smashing extras):</p>

<ul>

<li>a <strong>roundtrip flight to San Francisco, USA</strong>,</li>

<li>full accommodation in a fancy hotel,</li>

<li>a ticket to the <a href="https://www.smashingconf.com/sf-2018/">Smashing Conference San Francisco 2018</a>,</li>

<li>any Smashing workshop ticket of your choice,</li>

<li>life-time access to the <a href="/membership/">Smashing Membership</a>,</li>

<li>a signed edition of the <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/printed-books/design-systems/">Design Systems</a> book by Alla Kholmatova,</li>

<li>your very own Smashing caricature, designed just for you.</li>

</ul>

## How Does It Work?

<p>Below you’ll find the first of a few <strong>animated GIFs that contain a hidden key</strong>. The key is always exactly one emoji. Your job is to find these emoji as fast as possible. If your guess is right, you’ll have to confirm it by finding a way to get to the next level. But you'll have to find the way to get there on your own.</p>

<p>First, try to answer the question stated in the file name  with one single emoji. Then think about how to get to the next level. No need to leave the page. No need to buy anything in the shop. No need to sign in. Just look closely — <strong>look closely and watch out for cats.</strong> In fact, there are at least 5 cats on this page. Find them.</p>

<p>Once you’ve reached the last level (<em>you'll know it</em>), just tweet out all the discovered emoji in one single tweet at <a href="https://www.twitter.com/smashingmag">@smashingmag</a>.</p>

<p>To avoid spoilers, comments are closed for this post. All right, let's get down to business. Are you ready? Action! (And good luck!)</p>

## Level 1: What Am I Dreaming About?

<p>Your goal is to <strong>answer the question with one emoji</strong>. Pay attention to filenames. Think about how to get to the next level. Hint: watch out for <em>cats</em>. Ready? Go!</p>

The first to find all the emoji were Dawid Gaweł, Łukasz Łabędzki, SkiX, Thomas Lin, Liam Yorke, Efrén Pastor, Mario Estrada and Musk M. Elon. We'll contact the winners shortly. The Mystery will be resolved soon. Have you resolved it yet? ;-)</p>
