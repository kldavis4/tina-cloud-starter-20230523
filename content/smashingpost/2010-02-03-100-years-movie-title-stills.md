I'm always observing graphic design in different things. The other day, while I was watching something on TV, the design of the title screen caught my attention. I figured that this would be a great idea to post on Design Informer. I quickly got to work and started researching. Come to find out that there were some great sites that have already collected <strong>hundreds of movie title stills</strong>.

Anyway, it's really fascinating to look back at the past and see the way that they designed things back then. This post is kind of like a blast from the past. You'll get a chance to see some designs from the 1900's all the way up until 2009. So enough of my chattering, let's take a look at this <strong>showcase of movie title stills from the last 100 years</strong>.
