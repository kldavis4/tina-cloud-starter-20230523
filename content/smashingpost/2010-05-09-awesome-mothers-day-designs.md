  It's been a while since I've posted an
  [inspiration](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/category/inspiration/ "Inspiration
  Posts") post and I thought I would do one today. Well, I have something
  special for this post. As we all know, today is Mother's Day (in the US, not
  sure about other countries). Mother's Day happens once a year and it's a day
  when we celebrate and recognize mothers and motherhood in general. In this
  post, I've gathered up some **awesome Mother's Day designs** for your viewing
  pleasure.

It's been a while since I've posted an inspiration post and I thought I would do one today. Well, I have something special for this post.

<blockquote>Men are what their mothers made them.
<strong>— Ralph Waldo Emerson</strong></blockquote>

Let's face it, without our mother's we all would not be here. I'm thankful that I have a mother who raised me and took good care of me and cared for me when I was growing up, and by the way, <strong>I love her to death!</strong>

So for all the mother's out there and to my mom, this post is for you.
