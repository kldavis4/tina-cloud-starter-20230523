<p>Learn from industry-leading speakers like <strong>Romain Guy</strong> and <strong>Chet Haase</strong> who have been building Android since 1.0, <strong>Jhey Tompkins</strong> and <strong>Una Kravets</strong> from the Google Chrome team, or <strong>Robert Crowe</strong> from the TensorFlow team who will talk about trends in ML development.

<h2>Where Will Donations Go?</h2>

<p>All funds raised will support different causes in a transparent, public way. If you want to learn more about the organizations, the <em>DevFest for Ukraine</em> team summarized <a href="https://devfest.gdg.org.ua/why-these-organizations/">why they chose them</a>.</p>

<p>The initial goal was to raise $50,000. Thanks to multiple donations from individuals and partners, theyâ€™ve already reached their $50,000 and $75,000 milestones. And now they set a new goal â€” raising $100,000. With these funds, they can buy about 1,000 first aid kits, or 320 bulletproof vests, or 60 tons of humanitarian aid, which can save the lives of thousands of our Ukrainian friends. Letâ€™s do it together!</p>
