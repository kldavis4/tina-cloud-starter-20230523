**Imagine a cloudy, rainy November evening.** After a long day, you walk home along the streets, following the dimmed street lamps. Everybody seems to be busy, rushing somewhere, crossing paths with strangers and lonely stores. It's dark and cold outside, and it's difficult to see things through, so you decide to take a shortcut route to shorten the path.

Suddenly you see a bright light and music streaming from one of the remote corners of the street. Out of curiosity, you slowly walk towards the light, and hold your breath for a second. You discover a **cozy little place** with a fireplace, packed with people, jazzy tunes, and the smell of pizza, pasta and red wine. You see people smiling. Talking. Laughing. Sharing. Inviting you to join them.</p>

Somethin' is cookin' in the kitchen!" /></a><figcaption>That's right! Somethin' is cookin' in the kitchen!</figcaption></figure>

You probably have a whole bunch of reasons to keep on walking down that street, but what if you walked inside instead? Well, that's what joining the Smashing Conference experience feels like: It's an **intimate, personal, friendly experience for web designers and developers** — in a cozy venue with charm and personality, with people who deeply care about the quality of their work. Don't take our word — [see for yourself](https://www.flickr.com/photos/marcthiele/sets/72157672950578072).

Guess what: we have [SmashingConf San Francisco 2017](https://smashingconf.com/) coming up in April next year, featuring tasty **front-end** ingredients, **UX** recipes and neat design beats from the hidden, remote corners of the web. 1 track, 2 conference days, 8 workshops, 16 excellent speakers and just 500 available tickets, taking place on **April 4–5, 2017**. And it's going to be... _smashing_!

## About The Conference

So you know what's going on in front-end. You've been working with pattern libraries and atomic design and Gulp and SMCSS and BEM and HTTP/2 and Flexbox and SVG. What you might not know though is what **pitfalls and traps other web designers have encountered in practice** — to prevent issues creeping up on you later on.

With our [conference in San Francisco](https://sf17.smashingconf.com/), we bring together experienced speakers to share practical front-end and UX techniques and pitfalls they ran into, lessons they've learned and the workflows they've chosen to stay efficient. Expect an **intimate, hands-on conference experience**, with lots of learning, sharing and networking along the way. Admittedly, we can't solve every problem faced by the web community, but for front-end and UX, these conferences will push your boundaries significantly and give you answers you can take to the bank.</p>

<figure class="fwi"><a href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/1beb24c8-1bc8-4811-bd29-5a5bdb607c7d/palace-of-fine-arts.jpg"><img class="radius" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/1beb24c8-1bc8-4811-bd29-5a5bdb607c7d/palace-of-fine-arts.jpg" width="640" height="419" alt="Palace of Fine Arts San Francisco" title="SmashingConf San Francisco 2017" /></a><figcaption><a href="https://smashingconf.com/sf-2016">SmashingConf SFO 2017</a> is a two-day event taking place in the very heart of San Francisco. If you've always wanted to visit the city, or just happen to live around the corner (well, more or less), this is just the opportunity you've been waiting for. (<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/brookward/23104700225/in/faves-38416873@N00/">Image credit</a>)</figcaption></figure>

The conference will cover CSS/JavaScript techniques, SVG and Flexbox gotchas, architecting and "selling" design systems libraries, performance optimization and psychology insights, UX strategies and design workflows, tips on establishing and maintaining pattern libraries, and steps to produce resilient, fast responsive websites. All **learned from actual, real-life projects**.

**We don't care about trends**, but we do care about smart solutions. We love exploring how designers and developers work and how actual problems are solved—ideas and techniques that actually worked, or failed in real-life projects, and _why exactly_ they failed and what decisions were made instead. All those things that help us make smarter design decisions and build better products, faster.</p>

<p>That's exactly what the conference will be about. <strong>No theory, no fluff</strong>, just curated quality content</strong>. 2 conference days, 1 track, <a href="https://sf17.smashingconf.com/workshops">hands-on workshops</a> and <a href="https://sf17.smashingconf.com/speakers">16 speakers</a>, taking place on <strong>April 4–5, 2017</strong> in the beautiful and iconic Palace of Fine Arts. Of course, we embrace respect and tolerance with our <a href="https://sf17.smashingconf.com/codeofconduct">code of conduct</a>.

## Schedule

For this year's line-up, we invited experts who have worked in small as well as large companies. People who spend day and night working and playing with web technologies. It doesn't get more practical than that, does it? Get ready, set, go:

## See You In San Francisco!
<p>We’d love you to come and join us. Walk in. Take a seat. We are looking forward to seeing you in San Francisco, and who knows, perhaps months later after the conference is over, you'll look back at your workflow, at your projects and at this very post realizing that it wasn't that off after all. Grab your ticket and see you there! ;-)</p>
