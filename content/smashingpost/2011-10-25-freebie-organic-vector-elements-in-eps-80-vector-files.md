### Behind the Design

As always, here are some insights from the designer:
<blockquote>"By nature, Web design is a decidedly "indoorsy" activity. Maybe that's why we love opportunities to work with the organic! This vector set <strong>allows you to design with nature's paintbrush</strong>. Inspired by some of our favorite parts of the great outdoors, these elements will add a natural feel to your projects.

We don't always have the privilege of walking through a sunny meadow or feeling fallen leaves crunch under our feet. But hopefully these organic vectors will bring a bit of that serenity indoors and allow you to <strong>add a touch of nature to your next design project</strong>. Enjoy!"</blockquote>

Thank you, guys. We appreciate your work and your good intentions!
