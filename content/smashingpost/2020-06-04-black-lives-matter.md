Contributing to positive change is difficult, but it’s the right pursuit, no matter how much effort it takes. For years here at Smashing, we’ve been working with our dear authors and speakers, as well as students and professionals around the world, to share insights and practical techniques to work better and faster. We’re very much committed to that mission, and it’s always an incredible feeling to meet somebody who has read one of our articles, or attended one of our workshops, who still remembers their experience as that one little step that helped progress their career as a result.

Yet that’s only one part of a larger story &mdash; a story of injustice, denial of opportunity, and inequality in our world. For years, we’ve been addressing this issue head-on by diversifying our authors and line-ups, introducing new voices to the stage, mentoring students around the world, coaching tech speakers, and providing diversity and student tickets for our conferences. It’s a constant and very dedicated effort that reflects the values and principles of our little team, and we are committed to it for years to come.

We stand firmly behind the Black Lives Matter movement. We stand strongly behind introducing a wide range of Black voices to Smashing publications and conferences. We remain committed to providing a platform for the Black community to use our platform to make their voices heard. The entire team is committed to introducing and promoting the work of underrepresented people in our community, and to bringing a more diverse lineup to the magazine and conferences.
