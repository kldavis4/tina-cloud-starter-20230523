This year, SmashingConf took place at the Fort Mason Center which has superb views of the Bay and Golden Gate Bridge. The weather was very kind to us making it a very pleasant location to spend a few days in.

As always with any Smashing Conference, there were plenty of surprises! We had icecream and cookies, our amazing DJ Tobi Lessnow kept everyone well entertained between talks, and Vitaly opened the conference with just the right amount of balloons!

## Workshops

Workshops are a great way to spend a day really thinking about a subject. We ran workshops on Monday (the day before) and on Thursday (the day after the conference); they were all sold out, and the rooms were packed! I got to demo subgrid in my workshop which had just appeared in an early build of Firefox the day previously, so they were some of the first people outside of Mozilla to get to see that working.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here is the cards example for my <a href="https://twitter.com/smashingconf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@smashingconf</a> workshop tomorrow, which I use to explain why we need subgrid and now I&#39;ll be able to demo. See how the footers line up even if they contain different amounts of content? That&#39;s useful. <a href="https://t.co/xqoxPbCCeF">pic.twitter.com/xqoxPbCCeF</a></p>&mdash; Rachel Andrew (@rachelandrew) <a href="https://twitter.com/rachelandrew/status/1117393412150312960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 14, 2019</a></blockquote>

## Side Events

We always want to offer more than the conference, and try to arrange a bunch of side events which offer something for everyone.

### Jam Session

On Monday, before the conference began, we had a Jam Session, organized by Mozilla and Shopify and held at the Mozilla offices. In addition to drinks and snacks, there were several micro-talks including:

- “Creative Design With CSS Shapes And `clip-path`,” *Mandy Michael*
- “Building Accessible Experiences,” *Tiffany Tse*
- “The Power Of Code–Based Design,” *Marcin Treder*
- “Axe-Pro: A New Kind Of Accessibility Tool,” *April Ellsey*
- “Scroll Up! Scroll Up! A Tale Of Animating Over 10,000 Data Points,” *Becky Rush*
- “What’s New At Mozilla,” *Ali Spivak*

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Great Jam Session hosted by <a href="https://twitter.com/Shopify?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@shopify</a> tonight for <a href="https://twitter.com/smashingconf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@smashingconf</a>!

### Graffiti Walk

Also on Monday, we got together for a [graffiti walk](https://clarionalleymuralproject.org/) led by Scott Whitehead. A group of attendees spent time together exploring the street art of the Clarion Alley Art Street.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A few photos from the Graffiti walk we did at <a href="https://twitter.com/smashingconf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@smashingconf</a> San Francisco 2019! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/smashingconf?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#smashingconf</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/streetart?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#streetart</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/graffiti?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#graffiti</a> <a href="https://t.co/wQxt78qP5A">pic.twitter.com/wQxt78qP5A</a></p>&mdash; Scott Whitehead (@scottwhitebread) <a href="https://twitter.com/scottwhitebread/status/1119018131773464577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 18, 2019</a></blockquote>

### The Smashing Run Club

At Smashing SF 2018, Josh Clark suggested a morning run, which I helped organize. I thought we should continue the tradition this year and we had two lovely runs on both conference days out towards the Golden Gate Bridge. It has to be one of the most scenic locations possible for a conference run. It really is a great way to start a day of sitting and learning, by stretching your legs and getting some fresh air.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Well done SmashingConf SF runners! 🏃🏼‍♀️ 🏃🏻‍♂️ <a href="https://t.co/kGqRD3a7BD">pic.twitter.com/kGqRD3a7BD</a></p>&mdash; Drew McLellan (@drewm) <a href="https://twitter.com/drewm/status/1118169501491535873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 16, 2019</a></blockquote>

### Conference Party

I was surprised to see so many Wednesday morning conference runners, as on Tuesday night we had a party sponsored by Speedcurve. There were drinks, mediterranean food, and the venue was filled with old-school arcade games!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yesterday thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/smashingconf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@smashingconf</a>  a dream from my childhood came true!

### The Photo Walk

After the final day of the conference, some attendees went off on a [photo walk](https://smashingconf.com/sf-2019/photo-walk), to enjoy a pleasant San Francisco evening. If you have any photos from that we would love to see them &mdash; drop a note in the comments.
