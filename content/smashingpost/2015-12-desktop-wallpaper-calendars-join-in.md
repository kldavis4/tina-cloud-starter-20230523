The monthly wallpaper series was first launched in 2010, back in the time when we started searching for creative designers and artists to be featured on Smashing Magazine. Since then, we've had <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/wallpapers/">remarkable desktop wallpapers</a> designed by various artists from all around the globe. It would be our pleasure, dear readers, for you to share your artworks with all of us and <strong>we heartily welcome you to join in</strong> the monthly wallpaper submissions here on Smashing Magazine!

### How Do I Participate?

To get started, please read the <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/provide/wallpapers/wallpaper-guidelines.pdf">Smashing Wallpaper Guidelines</a> first.

### What Do We Expect?

Please feel free to browse through <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/tag/wallpapers/">our selection of desktop wallpapers</a> to get the idea behind what is needed to get featured on Smashing Magazine. Please consider that not every wallpaper will be published as we'll carefully analyze each work and will select only those wallpapers which have the most creative and artistic potential.

In order to be featured, the wallpapers need to send a message across — not simply some sort of advertising. We are sure that you would be quite proud if you knew that a great number of people across the globe are using <em>your</em> desktop wallpaper on their computers!

The wallpapers are published on the last day of every month. Notice that we respect the ideas and motivation behind each and every artist and their work which is why <strong>we give you the full freedom to explore your creativity</strong> through your artwork. And this is also why the theme of the wallpaper isn’t anyhow influenced by us, but designed from scratch all by yourself!

Feel free to design bold, intriguing, crazy, personal, but creative, unusual and absolutely stunning wallpapers.
