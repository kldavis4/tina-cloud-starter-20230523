  Although CSS isn't _that_ difficult, useful CSS techniques are not easy to
  find. Sometimes finding a cross-browser solution might take time, but you
  don't have to reinvent the wheel every single time. Other designers may have
  had the same problem in the past and thus the main goal of this round-up is to
  share with you a goldmine of new techniques which you will hopefully find very
  useful and valuable. We also hope that these tutorials and articles will help
  you solve common design problems and find new ways of approaching tricky CSS
  issues.

  The main goal of the article is to **present powerful new CSS techniques**,
  encourage experimentation in the design community and push CSS forward. Please
  notice that we feature both experimental demos and practical techniques in
  this article. Next week we will present even more useful new tools and
  resources for front-end developers. We sincerely appreciate the efforts of the
  design community — thank you, guys!

## Interesting and Original Techniques

<a href="https://www.is-real.net/experiments/css3/wonder-webkit/">Wonder-Webkit: 3D Transforms</a>
This is a remarkable example of what can be done using CSS3 3D transformations. The interesting stuff is the possibility of manipulate the transformation matrix of any element of the DOM, In this case we get the matrix given only the four end points of the element. Don't forget to click on the items, too. Who thought a couple of years ago that something like that would be possible with only CSS?

<a href="https://www.zurb.com/playground/css-boxshadow-experiments">CSS Box Shadow and Text Shadow Experiments</a>
The CSS <code>box-shadow</code> and <code>text-shadow</code> allow us to create some pretty cool design elements that don't even look like shadows. The key is to think about how CSS shadows work and use them to get the desired effect. The article features three remarkable examples of using <code>box-shadow</code> property creatively to achieve effects that don't have much to do with shadows.

<a href="https://forrst.com/posts/CSS3_Depth_of_Field-4zh">CSS3 Depth of Field</a>
Sawyer Hollenshead's experiment is an attempt to create the "Depth of Field" effect with CSS. The blurry text is accomplished using <code>text-shadow</code>, with the text color set to <code>transparent</code>. Take a look at the <span class="removed_link" title="https://shakenandstirredweb.com/playground/blur/">demo</span> and don't forget to press 'n' to toggle animation.

<a href="https://manufacturaindependente.com/colorfont/">Art Deco Selectable Text</a>
This is a quick proof-of-concept of split typography, based on Pierre Fix-Masseau's Art Deco style. The challenge was to have this kind of 'split letters' as part of a web page layout, while retaining the ability to select text.

CSS3 :toggle-button without JavaScript
This demo presents a CSS3 toggle-button that works without JavaScript. If you ever need it: You stack two <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>s on top of each other and then disable pointer-events for the top <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> on <code>:target</code>.

About War and Bananas
This student project explores new ways of styling and designing websites in an artistic way. The students from Merz Akademie in Germany used Picasso's "Guernica" as the footage, seperated the picture into different layers and animated them using CSS.

![About war and bananas](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/67011759-6c34-4e1f-af83-7ea0aeb848f7/css-150.jpg)

<a href="https://onotakehiko.com/webkitclock/">WebKit Clock</a>
This demo is driven by HTML5 canvas, CSS3, JavaScript, Web Fonts, SVG and no image files. The CSS file is huge, yet the result is quite remarkable.

<a href="https://www.designmadeingermany.de/slideshow/#a1">Pure CSS Slideshow</a>
This technique uses CSS transforms and positioning to create the pure CSS-based slideshow. Unfortunately, no documentation is available (yet).

CSS Dock
This is a quick CSS3 experiment trying to replicate the Dock of OS X, complete with labels, animations, reflections and indicators. It uses CSS transitions for the magnification effect and the <code>:target</code> pseudo-class and CSS animations for the bouncing effect.

![CSS Dock](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/1f945910-93d1-45de-99f6-58d982298fbd/new-css-techniques-108.jpg)

<a href="https://www.andrew-hoyer.com/experiments/walking/">Andrew Hoyer</a>
An interesting experiment by Andrew Hoyer. The walking man is implemented using only CSS3 animations and simple HTML. The key idea behind all of this is the fact that a CSS transformation applied to an element also applies to all of its children. Works in Webkit-browsers only.

[![Andrew Hoyer](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2c5968ed-8282-48a5-8ccf-0bb142e813fb/new-css-techniques-197.jpg)](https://www.andrew-hoyer.com/experiments/walking/)

<a href="https://blog.typekit.com/2011/02/10/type-study-an-all-css-button/">Type study: An all CSS button</a>
Dan Cederholm explains how through the use of <code>box-shadow</code>, <code>text-shadow</code>, <code>border-radius</code>, and CSS gradients, we can create a highly polished three-dimensional, responsive button that doesn’t require images.

[![Type study: An all CSS button](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ef973e3f-691e-41d3-9061-38b498656730/new-css-techniques-103.jpg)](https://blog.typekit.com/2011/02/10/type-study-an-all-css-button/)

<a href="https://markdotto.com/playground/3d-text/">3D Text</a>
This technique uses multiple <code>text-shadow</code>s to create a 3D appearance of the text on any HTML element. No extra mark-up is used. Works in the latest builds of Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and Opera.

[![3D Text](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ad845a09-b5cb-43ac-a0e3-fb61bf402ae6/3d-text.jpg)](https://markdotto.com/playground/3d-text/)

Spin those Icons with CSS3
Tom Kenny features a neat effect which spins the social icons with the help of a CSS transforms and transition when you hover over them. A very nice enhancement.

<a href="https://nicolasgallagher.com/css-background-image-hacks/">CSS background image hacks</a>
Emulating background image crop, background image opacity, background transforms, and improved background positioning. The article explains a few hacks relying on CSS pseudo-elements to emulate features unavailable or not yet widely supported by modern browsers.

<a href="https://tutorialzine.com/2010/11/better-select-jquery-css3/">Making Better Select Elements with CSS3 and jQuery</a>
This tutorial explains how to take an ordinary <code>select</code> element, and replace it with a better looking version, while keeping all the functionality intact. It uses CSS3 multiple background and a transparent PNG image as a sprite. Currently, multiple backgrounds are supported by Firefox, Safari, Chrome and Opera. For Internet Explorer and older versions of the first browsers, a fallback is defined, which is basically just a regular version of the background. When parsing the CSS document, browsers that do not understand multiple background will just ignore the rule and use the plain one.

<a href="https://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/build-a-kickbutt-css-only-3d-slideshow/">CSS-Only 3D Slideshow</a>
This tutorial shows how to create a 3D slideshow using only HTML and CSS. No JavaScript required. You'll be able to mimic a click event with CSS using the <code>:focus</code> pseudo-class and the HTML5 element <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code>, but the idea is the same. As the author admits, this method isn’t necessarily “better” than using JavaScript, but simply a neat alternative that takes advantages of the newest HTML5 elements.

"What about having an owl that moved his eyes every so often and when hovered over would raise his wings while a few light rays would spin in the background. A little excessive? Probably. Necessary? Not at all. However, that's exactly what I was looking to do with CSS3 transforms, transitions, and animations." An interesting experiment, best viewed in Safari or Chrome.

<a href="https://www.jankoatwarpspeed.com/post/2010/05/23/microsoft-office-minibar-jQuery-CSS3.aspx">How to create Microsoft Office Minibar with jQuery and CSS3</a>
Janko Jovanovic explains how to create a Microsoft Office Minibar that exposes context-related functionality. In case of MS Word, context is a text selection. Since Minibar always pops up near the mouse pointer it enables users to quickly perform actions related to a selection.

[![Why and how to create Microsoft Office Minibar with jQuery and CSS3](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c539ac49-5694-4254-8587-bb97aae81446/new-css-techniques-171.jpg)](https://www.jankoatwarpspeed.com/post/2010/05/23/microsoft-office-minibar-jQuery-CSS3.aspx)

<a href="https://cssglobe.com/angled-content-mask-with-css">Angled Content Mask with CSS</a>
This article explains how to create angled CSS content "masks". The idea is pretty simple and uses CSS transform property (rotation, to be more precise).

[![Angled content mask with CSS](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/316cbaad-593a-4f52-961b-919e3e38a922/bicycle.jpg)](https://cssglobe.com/angled-content-mask-with-css)

<a href="https://css-tricks.com/rotating-feature-boxes/">Rotating Feature Boxes</a>
All the animation here are CSS3 transitions. JavaScript only watches for the clicks and applies and removes classes as needed. So when you click on a block, that block's class' is adjusted. The new classes have different size and position values. Because the block has transition CSS applied, those new sizes and postion values are animated as well.

New @Font-Face Syntax: Simpler, Easier
With IE9 and FF4 nearing release, Ethan Dunham from Font Squirrel has revisited the problem of a cross-browser CSS @font-face syntax and found a new and simpler solution. In this article, Richard Fink explains the new syntax and its variations and suggests the most reasonable syntax to use. Also, check FontSpring's <a href="https://www.fontspring.com/blog/the-new-bulletproof-font-face-syntax">The New Bulletproof @font-face Syntax</a>. Please notice that this technique no longer works in Internet Explorer 9.

<a href="https://perishablepress.com/press/2009/12/06/new-clearfix-hack/">The New Clearfix Method</a>
The clearfix hack, or "easy-clearing" hack, is a useful method of clearing floats. The <a href="https://perishablepress.com/press/2008/06/18/css-hackz-series-clearing-floats-with-the-clearfix-hack/">original clearfix hack</a> works great, but the browsers that it targets are either obsolete or well on their way. The new clearfix method applies clearing rules to standards-compliant browsers using the <code>:after</code> pseudo-class. For IE6 and IE7, the new clearfix method triggers <code>hasLayout</code> with some proprietary CSS. Thus, the New Clearfix method effectively clears floats in all currently used browsers without using any hacks.

Jeffrey Way shares with us a quick tip with a video that will illustrate a nifty technique by using plain and simple CSS to mimic click events.

<a href="https://css-tricks.com/triangle-breadcrumbs/">Breadcrumb Navigation with CSS Triangles</a>
This article describes a fairly simple technique for creating triangles with pure CSS. You just make a block level element with zero width and height, a colored border on one side, and transparent borders on the two adjacent sides. Useful for little arrow sticking out from speech bubbles, navigation pointers, and more.

<a href="https://filamentgroup.com/lab/responsive_images_experimenting_with_context_aware_image_sizing/">Responsive Images: Experimenting with Context-Aware Image Sizing</a>
Since Ethan Marcotte coined the term, responsive Web design has gained a lot of attention in the Web design community, mainly due to its remarkable potential for flexible layouts that respond to the browser’s viewport for the best user experience. The main problem with such designs, however, is figuring out how to serve small images to mobile devices and tablets and large ones to desktop displays. The goal of this technique is to deliver optimized, contextual image sizes for responsive layouts that utilize dramatically different image sizes at different resolutions.

[![Responsive Images: Experimenting with Context-Aware Image Sizing](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/5f68a948-b5b7-4340-90c1-984ec6f66fed/new-css-techniques-121.jpg)](https://filamentgroup.com/lab/responsive_images_experimenting_with_context_aware_image_sizing/)

<a href="https://csswizardry.com/2011/02/css-powered-ribbons-the-clean-way/">CSS powered ribbons the clean way</a>
Harry Roberts presents a simple technique that uses an image and CSS to create clean ribbons. This technique creates a white <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> with a pink background, pulls the &lt;h2&gt; out of the content area with a negative margin and then places the image absolutely left-bottom of the <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> in a <code>:before</code> pseudo-element.

[![CSS powered ribbons the clean way](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a41e0170-6254-41cc-9cb8-a510b1bba2e5/new-css-techniques-123.jpg)](https://csswizardry.com/2011/02/css-powered-ribbons-the-clean-way/)

<a href="https://csswizardry.com/2011/01/create-a-centred-horizontal-navigation/">Create a centred horizontal navigation</a>
Centring block level elements is easy, just define a <code>width</code> and set <code>margin: 0 auto;</code>, but what if you don't know that fixed width? You could use <code>text-align: center</code>;, but that won't work on 100%-width block-level elements either. However, there is a way to have a centred horizontal navigation without knowing an explicit width, and without adding CSS.

<a href="https://css-tricks.com/keep-margins-out-of-link-lists/">Keep Margins Out of Link Lists</a>
When building a menu or other list of links, it's generally a good practice to use <code>display: block;</code> or <code>display: inline-block;</code> so that you can increase the size of the link target. The simple truth: bigger link targets are easier for people to click and lead to better user experience. Make sure list items don't have padding, but links do and don't use margins, so there are no un-clickable gaps.

<a href="https://leaverou.me/2011/01/styling-children-based-on-their-number-with-css3/">Styling children based on their number, with CSS3</a>
Lea Verou presents an interesting technique for styling children based on their number. It is based on the relationship between <code>:nth-child</code> and <code>:nth-last-child</code>. With the technique, the number of total rules is still O(N), but the number of selectors in every rule becomes just 2, making this trick practical for far larger numbers of children.

<a href="https://perishablepress.com/press/2010/06/01/wrapping-content/">Wrapping Long URLs and Text Content with CSS</a>
To wrap long URLs, strings of text, and other content, it's enough to apply a carefully crafted chunk of CSS code to any block-level element (e.g., perfect for <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tags). Very useful for cases when code snippets need to be presented in a blog post with a fixed content width.

Pure CSS(3) accordion
An interesting accordion technique that uses nothing but semantic HTML, CSS and some progressive CSS3. There are also two versions, a horizontal one and a vertical one.

<a href="https://css-tricks.com/limit-html-width/">Rein In Fluid Width By Limiting HTML Width</a>
If you are making a fluid width site but wish to limit the maximum width it can expand, you can do so easily by literally applying a <code>max-width</code> to the <code>html</code> element. Quick and useful tip.

<a href="https://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2010/11/15/inline-boxes-with-bottom-alignment/">Inline Boxes with Bottom Alignment</a>
Imagine that you want to keep a "Submit" button at the bottom of a line box, aligned with form controls positioned below their label (see below). If the containing block is not wide enough for the "Submit" button to flow next to the other controls, that button must be displayed at the beginning of the next line box with minimal space above it. The article explains a solution for this problem.

[![CSS Quick Tip: Inline Boxes with Bottom Alignment](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/fb8f9ab2-0248-4b41-898c-e951d59f3d55/css-168.jpg)](https://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2010/11/15/inline-boxes-with-bottom-alignment/)

<a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/10/31/transparent-css-sprites/">Transparent CSS Sprites</a>
The idea of the technique is to create a transparent sprite allowing the <code>background-color</code> to show through. If you are familiar with CSS Sprites, you should be able to grasp this twist relatively easily. Simply, an image with a transparent “knocked-out” transparent center is placed over a background colour. Changing the background colour changes the appearance of the element.

<a href="https://nicolasgallagher.com/jump-links-and-viewport-positioning/">Jump links and viewport positioning</a>
"Using within-page links presses the jumped-to content right at the very top of the viewport. This can be a problem when using a fixed header. With a bit of hackery, there are some CSS methods to insert space between the top of the viewport and the target element within a page."

<a href="https://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/quick-tip-mimic-equal-columns-with-css3-gradients/">Mimic Equal Columns with CSS3 Gradients</a>
"What happens when your main content area needs two specific background colors: one for the primary content, and another for the sidebar? If you’ve ever tried applying the background to each container itself, you’ll no doubt have realized that your layout quickly becomes fragmented as soon as the primary content section exceeds the height of the sidebar. Generally, the solution is to set a background image on the parent element, and set it to repeat vertically. However, if we get clever with CSS3 gradients, we can achieve the same effect with zero images." A nice piece by Jeffrey Way.

<a href="https://css-tricks.com/double-click-in-css/">Double Click in CSS</a>
There has been some interesting talk about how we essentially lose the :hover pseudo class in CSS as well as mouseenter, mouseleave, and mousemove in JavaScript. Now, here is the idea: can we somehow pull off a double click with pure CSS? Yes, we can, if the input covers link, buries on focus, which triggers hover on link keeping it on top. Work on WebKit (including Mobile) and Firefox. So we've basically created a "light" alternative to hover for the sequence tap → change state / activate link → tap again to visit link.

<a href="https://www.impressivewebs.com/center-multiple-divs/">Center Multiple DIVs with CSS</a>
At some point, you may have a situation where you want to center multiple elements (maybe <code>«div»</code> elements, or other block elements) on a single line in a fixed-width area. Centering a single element in a fixed area is easy. Just add <code>margin: auto</code> and a fixed width to the element you want to center, and the margins will force the element to center. You can achieve something similar by taking advantage of CSS’s flexibity with “recasting” elements.

<a href="https://www.webdesignerwall.com/tutorials/css-clearing-floats-with-overflow/">Clearing Floats with Overflow</a>
One of the common problems we face when coding with float-based layouts is that the wrapper container doesn't expand to the height of the child floating elements. The typical solution to fix this is by adding an element with clear float after the floating elements or adding a clearfix to the wrapper. But you can also use the <code>overflow</code> property to fix this problem. It's not a new trick, but still very useful.

<a href="https://css-tricks.com/different-transitions-for-hover-on-hover-off/">Different Transitions for Hover On / Hover Off</a>
The idea of this technique is to solve an interesting problem: what about using different transition for hover on and off? In the example, when you hover over, the <code>:hover</code> transition overrides the transition set in the regular state, and that property animates. When you hover off, the transition from the regular state takes over and that property animates. Useful.

The CSS3 text-shadow property has been around for some time now and is commonly used to recreate Photoshop's Drop Shadow type shading to add subtle shadows which help add depth, dimension and to lift an element from the page. A demo is available if you'd like to see what it looks like before you give it a try yourself.

It's always nice to be able to add a vignetting effect to photos sans-Photoshop, but the way browsers interpret box-shadow:inset is to throw the shadow behind the image, rendering it invisible. While this seems pretty useless, it does make sense when you consider other kinds of content.
