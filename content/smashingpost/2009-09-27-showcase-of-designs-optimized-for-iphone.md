  Over the last couple of years, mobile devices have managed to gain mainstream
  popularity. With iPhone, making mobile Web applications finally usable by
  broad masses, web design can now be applied to mobile applications as well. In
  this post we are focusing on designs that are specifically optimized for
  mobile devices, in particular iPhone.

  Though iPhone's Safari browser is able to render any website just like you
  would see it on a desktop browser, the available screen area is much smaller
  than in common "classic" displays. This poses a new challenge for designers
  and developers who now can reach millions of users that use mobile Web.
  Websites that are specifically **optimized for the iPhone** utilize the screen
  to the fullest extent, and use less bandwidth (which is necessary, because the
  connectivity is not always optimal).

  The iPhone browsing experience is quite different than the regular browsing
  experience. The buttons and hyperlinks have to be bigger because our fingers
  are not as sharp as the mouse pointer. Optimizing a website for iPhone is not
  rocket science. It's the same HTML, CSS and JavaScript that you already know.
  The only major difference is the screen size.

  In the showcase below we present some of the **interesting, interactive and
  beautiful designs that are optimized for the iPhone**. You will also learn
  about some handy iPhone development tools and resources that will help you
  optimize your website for the iPhone.

[Walmart](https://walmart.com/iphone)
