It can be an interesting experience looking around at websites in particular industries to identify trends and see how they differ from those in other industries. In this article, we'll take a look at the websites of major motion pictures to see what types of websites are being created. Movies are a big part of the entertainment industry, and in recent years their websites have become increasingly critical to their overall success.</p>

## The Purpose of Movie Websites

Before getting into the details of specific movie websites and discussing current trends, it's important first to consider the primary purpose of movie websites. Obviously, in order for a movie to be financially successful, it needs to do well at the box office, and today many moviegoers use the Internet to find movies to see and to buy tickets. Having things like trailers and other video clips helps to <strong>engage visitors</strong> and encourages them to <strong>find show times and buy tickets</strong> online.

{{% feature-panel %}}

Movies are <strong>made to entertain</strong> audiences, and movie websites are much the same. In order to get visitors' attention and encourage them to see the movie, a website needs to give them what they are looking for and provide some entertainment at the same time. Today's movie websites make it easy to take a couple minutes and watch a few trailers before deciding which movie to see.

Because the purpose of movie websites is to pique interest and sell tickets, they generally include:

*   Plenty of video, including trailers,
*   Easy access to show times and online ticket purchasing,
*   Cast bios and other general info.</p>

## Visitor Expectations

The design, style and content of a movie website is generally meant to meet visitors' expectations of that website. Visitors expect to find websites that are graphically rich, with audio and <strong>video</strong> as well. They expect something special, and entertainment value is often more important than the website being very accessible or fast-loading.

Visitors expect to be able to arrive on a movie website and determine within a few minutes if they want to see the movie. For this reason, trailers are key elements: they are almost always easy to find or automatically start when the home page loads.

The <strong>design style</strong> also reflects visitor expectations, and the movie itself. You can usually tell very quickly upon arriving on a website whether it is for a comedy, drama, horror or action movie.</p>

## Trends Of Current Movie Websites

Among the sample movie websites discussed in this article, the following trends are apparent.</p>

### 1. Flash

Most movie websites rely heavily on Flash for a dynamic and interactive experience. The audience of these websites typically expects to be entertained, so bells and whistles take priority, and heavy use of these elements is more acceptable than it would be on other types of websites.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/106a160f-2ab1-4ba5-adcb-3b8fd4d77b29/flash.jpg" alt="Flash" width="575" height="500" border="0" />

### 2. Large Background Images

In addition to Flash, larger photos and images play a huge role in creating attractive and interesting movie websites. Most movie websites make use of large images, in many cases as the background of the page.

<a href="https://www.lastchanceharvey.com/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0d959b1e-c897-4833-ae81-c52d8a859173/bgimg.jpg" alt="Background Image" width="575" height="500" border="0" /></a>

### 3. Video/Trailers

It's only natural to assume that the website of a movie would include some video. Almost all movie websites include a full trailer, and in some cases a few different trailers. Many websites put the trailer on the home page or a splash page, and the trailers often start without being prompted by the user.

While audio and video that automatically starts is usually considered a negative feature, because of their subject matter, movie websites are a bit different than the average website. Because video is a priority for most visitors, it seems to be an accepted fact that movie websites will play a trailer automatically when the page loads. Those movie websites that don't put the trailer on a splash page or the home page typically have a link in the navigation menu that clearly points to the trailer.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f3815bfa-a4be-4b2b-abd4-b536848b3cd1/trailer.jpg" alt="Gran Torino Trailer" width="575" height="500" />

### 4. Show Times and Ticket Info

Because the goal of movie websites is to sell tickets, each one includes a link or form for visitors who want to find show times and ticket information for their area. Many websites link to Fandango and/or Moviefone. Making it easy for people to get tickets is a priority.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8dd504ff-9a82-4f4a-96e8-0594e145063c/tickets.jpg" alt="Ticket Info" width="575" height="375" />

### 5. Splash Pages

About half of the movie websites we'll look at later in this article show a splash page before the visitor enters the main website. Some of these splash pages are more useful than others. Many include a video of the trailer, and some have options to access country-specific sections of the website if the movie is playing worldwide.

<a href="https://www.paulblartmallcop.com/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/cdbb5050-07ca-43ee-9176-5d105fe8c900/splash.jpg" alt="Paul Blart Splash Page" width="575" height="398" border="0" /></a>

### 6. Display of Nominations and Awards

Movie websites often attempt to demonstrate the quality of a movie by listing or displaying nominations and awards it has received. You'll see this a lot on splash pages and home pages of award-winning pictures.

<a href="https://www.benjaminbutton.com/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d77aee10-aaa0-40df-b6b7-cd20e82bde5a/nominations.jpg" alt="Benjamin Button Nominations" width="575" height="270" border="0" /></a>

### 7. Short Page Length

It's very common for movie websites to take up only the height of the screen, or just a bit more. It's rare to find pages that are long and require a lot of vertical scrolling. With most websites being Flash-based or set against a large background image, the short page length keeps everything in view at all times.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a1f4a528-be75-4491-9e27-7b94cbe15bf1/unborn.jpg" alt="Unborn" width="575" height="285" />

### 8. Not Always On Company Domain

Not all movie websites have their own domain. Some studios, such as <a href="https://www.foxsearchlight.com/">Fox Searchlight</a> and <a href="https://disney.go.com/index">Disney</a>, keep their movie websites on their own domains. The number of major movie websites that are on the main company domain is far more than those that have their own, but it is still a trend for some companies.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/94e4d948-5e19-4fd2-beaa-bef0e50a840f/fox.jpg" alt="Fox Searchlight" width="575" height="500" border="0" />

### 9. Social Networking /Media Interaction

Many movies have pages set up on Facebook and MySpace to take advantage of social networking opportunities. With the popularity of these social networking websites, especially among younger users, it's no surprise that movie companies are seeing the value of getting involved. A bit more surprising is the number of movie websites that include links to encourage votes on social media websites such as Digg, Delicious, StumbleUpon and Reddit.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/971ce724-2205-41cb-b97f-b10420ec526f/share.jpg" alt="Social Networking - Revolutionary Road" width="575" height="359" border="0" />

### 10. Downloads

Most movie websites include a downloads section where visitors can get free wallpaper, posters and buddy icons.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/1b03bf3b-57dd-4442-b795-03f3734a6394/downloads.jpg" alt="Downloads" width="575" height="468" />

### 11\. Fun Extras

Many movie websites, but not all, include more than just the typical movie and cast information along with the trailer. Games and activities are also very common. These elements can make the website more fun for visitors while also promoting the movie.

BrideWars includes Bridal Beatdown, a game in which you are one of the main characters in a boxing match. You can even upload your own photo to put on the character if you want.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8314a922-d239-4a75-ae7f-424d219763b2/bridewarsgame.jpg" alt="BrideWars Game" width="575" height="371" />

The website for He's Just Not That Into You includes a video by the male characters of the cast called The Top 10 Chick Flick Cliches That Are Not In This Movie.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/894702f6-b092-40bf-8630-2b3eb4bb1a4f/chickflick.jpg" alt="He's Just Not That Into You" width="575" height="287" />

### 12\. Widgets

Many movie websites also include widgets that visitors can put on their own websites or social networking pages.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e9ff956d-fba2-40cd-a8b2-9abde4519b73/widget.jpg" alt="Widget" width="575" height="500" />

## Showcase of Movie Websites

Now that we've looked at some of the trends of modern movie websites, let's take a look at 40 websites of recent and upcoming movies. The websites were chosen because the movies are current (or upcoming) and popular, rather than because they are the "best" examples movie websites.</p>

### [Taken](https://www.takenmovie.com/)

The website for Taken features the trailer in the center of the screen, with the option to view in full screen. The content of the website is set against a large dark background image. The navigation on the left side of the screen is simple and logical, making it easy for visitors to find what they want. Although audio plays automatically when the page is opened, it can easily be turned off with a conveniently located control.
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7e1f22b6-aa49-4dee-8d1a-e40fb23d1a4d/taken.jpg" alt="Taken" width="575" height="293" />

### [Paul Blart: Mall Cop](https://www.paulblartmallcop.com/)

Paul Blart: Mall Cop uses a splash page that allows visitors to find a theater and show times by searching by zip code. Lower on the page are links to the movie's pages on social networking websites like MySpace and Facebook.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/5c0f7cc7-e25f-44c7-9e6f-2d24d483615e/blartlanding.jpg" alt="Paul Blart: Mall Cop" width="575" height="304" />

Clicking on "Enter the Site Now" opens a new window for the main website, which can be annoying to visitors. The website includes a large background image of Paul Blart on a scooter. The main navigation of the website is cleverly presented as a mall directory. Throughout the website, you'll hear audio clips of mall security. Unlike many of the other websites, this one does not feature a trailer on the splash page or home page.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2e4c3166-fff8-43fd-97fb-2d48484b07aa/blart.jpg" alt="Paul Blart: Mall Cop" width="575" height="364" />

### [The Uninvited](https://www.uninvitedmovie.com/)

The website of The Uninvited has a dark design with hand-written text, including for the primary navigation. The style of the design is a good match for the type of movie it is. There is no splash page, and no trailer video plays upon arrival, but the trailer is accessible by clicking on "videos." After the trailer plays, you'll see options for embedding the video on another website, as well as for sharing via Facebook and email.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/01d87ddc-33bb-4aaa-8f40-32c8942fa138/uninvited.jpg" alt="The Uninvited" width="575" height="297" />

### [Hotel for Dogs](https://www.hotelfordogsmovie.com/)

Hotel for Dogs uses a splash page that allows visitors to find local showings and get tickets, but not much else. Because this option is also available inside the main website, the splash page seems unnecessary.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8af1a17b-9387-49e2-a263-c3a10dc8106a/hotellanding.jpg" alt="Hotel for Dogs " width="575" height="297" />

Once on the main website, you'll see a large background image. The navigation options pop out on hover, and there is more content available on this website than on many others. The content includes information on the Hotel for Dogs video game, the opportunity to "Post your pup" by uploading photos of your dog and some other interactive options.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/501744ba-37e1-414f-849d-6143fa0b728e/hotelfordogs.jpg" alt="Hotel for Dogs" width="575" height="354" />

### Gran Torino

The website of Gran Torino is fairly similar to that of Taken, with a large dark background image and the trailer playing in the center of the screen. Simple navigation options are at the bottom of the screen, and just below that is an option to find shows and buy tickets. A lot of information is available in the "About the Film" section.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/6825e065-a005-4157-bb6b-55352fc2c500/grantorino.jpg" alt="Gran Torino" width="575" height="299" />

### [Slumdog Millionaire](https://www.slumdogmillionairemovie.co.uk/)

Slumdog Millionaire has a splash page that displays the movie's many nominations, awards and positive reviews.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/42405d88-b54c-4ebf-97c1-490cb2d270a1/slumdoglanding.jpg" alt="Slumdog Millionaire" width="575" height="334" />

If you click on "Skip intro," you'll remain on a splash page that gives additional options, but you'll need to click again to enter the main website.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/002c0120-cdc8-47ec-9998-7beaee0078bf/slumdog.jpg" alt="Slumdog Millionaire" width="575" height="288" />

Once inside the website, you'll hear audio unless you turn it off at the bottom of the screen, but there is no video that plays without prompting. The main navigation menu includes a link to videos, including the trailer. In addition to the typical options, you have the opportunity to post your own review on the Slumdog micro-blog.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/dfa18717-f5f8-43d6-bdb2-b496c7d9dd30/slumdog2.jpg" alt="Slumdog Millionaire" width="575" height="301" />

### [Underworld: Rise of the Lycans](https://www.entertheunderworld.com/)

Underworld: Rise of the Lycans has a splash page with options to view the trailer, enter the website or get show times. There are also links to Facebook and MySpace pages. If you don't click on anything, the trailer plays on its own.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e4f17a76-60a8-43c4-a4f3-c155b38490ac/underworld.jpg" alt="Underworld: Rise of the Lycans" width="575" height="283" />

Both the splash page and main website feature large dark background images, which obviously fit the movie. The website is Flash-based, and the background is a huge image that scrolls horizontally. I found the navigation difficult to use.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/5f6bde95-3a21-4f33-9259-6fa38267c434/underworld2.jpg" alt="Underworld: Rise of the Lycans" width="575" height="325" />

### [New in Town](https://www.newintownmovie.com/)

The website for New in Town is a snowy Minnesota scene with snowflakes that continuously fall. In addition to the usual options and pages, a Minnesota Pronunciation Guide shows funny clips from the movie. There's also a "Try My Recipe" section where you can click on characters to see their recipes.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/59728275-d164-456c-83b4-7169c89b3276/newintown.jpg" alt="New in Town" width="575" height="279" />

### My Bloody Valentine

My Bloody Valentine 3D has a splash page that includes an option to find and buy tickets, as well as a link to a YouTube video of fan reviews of the movie.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/28f19cf3-ce95-4f73-ab6c-bb829038a6ca/bloodylanding.jpg" alt="My Bloody Valentine" width="575" height="286" />

Once inside, you'll see a dark website with red blood splatters. The style of the design fits well with what you would expect from a horror movie. There is a link to watch the trailer, as well as the typical navigational options. There's also an option to send a bloody Valentine's card to a friend.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8e26f4c4-4261-4f1c-9723-6b4bca5b64fc/bloody.jpg" alt="My Bloody Valentine" width="575" height="345" />

### Inkheart

Inkheart's website includes a large background image with several characters from the movie and some interesting lighting effects, In the center of the screen, a trailer plays unless the visitor stops it. The main navigation includes all the necessary items, such as information about the movie, additional videos and ticket information. The website also gives visitors the option of sending a "Toto E-Card."

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/65df9344-5ef0-4b69-b8c6-66808707e07b/inkheart.jpg" alt="Inkheart" width="575" height="284" />

### [The Curious Case of Benjamin Button](https://www.benjaminbutton.com/)

The Curious Case of Benjamin Button has a splash page with a solid black background and photos of the movie's stars, Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. Yellow text is used to draw attention to its nomination for 13 Academy Awards. The splash page includes links to buy tickets, film info and a trailer in HD.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f173cbc9-4107-4afe-b08d-1cb7e71061ba/button.jpg" alt="The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" width="575" height="281" />

Once you enter the website, the browser opens in full screen by default (you can hit "Escape" on your keyboard to exit the full screen), and photos of Benjamin Button's life rotate.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d0bac17a-af53-4f82-97f5-d6ea854e7d8f/button2.jpg" alt="Benjamin Button" width="575" height="391" />

### [BrideWars](https://www.bridewars.com/)

The website for BrideWars opens with a splash page that gives the options of entering the website, getting updates or finding show times and tickets. If you don't click on anything, it automatically takes you into the website.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/537fe2a3-aaab-4259-b36f-9cefca4ea1e4/bridewarslanding.jpg" alt="BrideWars" width="575" height="295" />

Once inside the website, you'll see the movie trailer in the center of the screen between the two brides, with navigational options below. One additional feature is the "Emma or Liv Quiz," which asks you a set of multiple choice questions and then tells you which of the two brides you are most like.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/41aef72b-b392-4ffe-8003-b599a22f887a/bridewars.jpg" alt="BrideWars" width="575" height="280" />

### Revolutionary Road

The Revolutionary Road website includes a large light background image of the movie's stars. To the left of the screen, a trailer plays automatically. Below the trailer are options to share the page through social networking and social media websites, including Facebook, Digg, Delicious, StumbleUpon and Reddit.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/5671962a-59ec-4fa8-9db2-4b48c864e22b/revolutionary.jpg" alt="Revolutionary Road" width="575" height="271" />

### Defiance

The website for Defiance also plays the trailer automatically upon page load. Behind the trailer is a large background image of a wooded area, with main navigational items at the top of the screen. Like the Revolutionary Road website, Defiance's includes social media icons for Facebook, Digg, Delicious, StumbleUpon and Reddit.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/de80a768-cffe-4f40-938a-0b0267b10e54/defiance.jpg" alt="Defiance" width="575" height="309" />

### [The Reader](https://www.thereader-movie.com/)

The splash page for The Reader is much more basic in design than that of many other movies. The page has a white background, with a video of the trailer playing in the center of the screen. At the top of the page is a notice that the movie has been nominated for five Academy Awards. Below the trailer you can click to enter the website.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/dc70bd6a-55e6-45f0-b573-8a89aaeb4f7f/reader.jpg" alt="The Reader" width="575" height="308" />

Inside the website, a major section of the screen displays the many excellent reviews the movie has received (this part of the layout can be closed to show more of the video). On the left are basic navigational options, including to find show times and tickets.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/20b6155e-9f7b-4bb6-99a0-454723951299/reader2.jpg" alt="The Reader" width="575" height="279" />

### The Wrestler

The Wrestler's website is located on FoxSearchlight.com and includes the standard navigation at the top, with links to the studio's other current movies.
