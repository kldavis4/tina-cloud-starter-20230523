  Web typography has evolved a lot over the last years. Today we see rich,
  accessible typography, a plethora of type design choices for the web and a number of remarkable, type-based web designs. It's a great time for web design, and it's a great time for web typography. Still, being as excited as we are, we should not forget about the foundational principles of **good type design on the web** and use them properly within our projects. Great choice is good, but, most importantly, we should be making meaningful typographic choices in our designs.

Alec Julien's introductory piece on how you can create some beautiful fonts with a little hard work, a lot of knowledge and a little inspiration. The series covers font editing software, transition from paper drawings to screen drawings, vertical and horizontal metrics and kerning. Don't forget to check out <a href="https://ilovetypography.com/2007/10/29/so-you-want-to-create-a-font-part-2/">part 2</a> as well.

<a href="https://www.typecastcreative.co.uk/2010/09/how-to-kern-type-perfectly/">Kerning Type and Great Typography</a>
There are lots of tips on the best way to perfectly kern a piece of type. As with all designs, kerning can be subjective, but some are just plain right or wrong.

Kerning is the art of spacing individual characters in a word so that they sit in correct relationship to one another, creating a subtle harmony and rhythm. In this article, Tom Sewell gives some recommendations for good letter spacing.

Hinting, or screen optimising, is the process by which TrueType or PostScript fonts are adjusted for maximum readability on computer monitors. This article compares different ways of hinting (black &amp; white, grey-scale, ClearType, DirectWrite) and explains the behaviour of fonts under different rasterisers.

This article introduces a series of posts about type rendering on the Web. The translation of a font’s outline into pixellated text of varying quality, consistency and sharpness is not straightforward. It involves both a font and a rendering engine, and only so much can be controlled by type designers and web designers.

<a href="https://blog.typekit.com/2010/10/21/type-rendering-web-browsers/">Type Rendering: Web Browsers</a>
Every great web browser has a layout engine that explicitly decides how to turn our markup, stylesheets and scripts into living, breathing websites. Layout engines have everything to do with how our web designs are generated and visualized. However, for the specific task of type rendering, layout engines almost always defer to the operating system’s text rendering engine. This article looks at how type rendering is affected, or not affected, by each popular web browser. Also, check <a href="https://blog.typekit.com/2010/10/15/type-rendering-operating-systems/">operating systems</a>.

<a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/11/02/the-ails-of-typographic-anti-aliasing/">The Ails Of Typographic Anti-Aliasing </a>
As printed typography enjoys the fruits of high-DPI glory, proudly displaying its beautiful curves and subtleties, its on-screen counterpart remains stifled by bulky pixels, living in a world of jagged edges, distorted letterforms and trimmed serifs. Until display manufacturers produce affordable 200 or 300 PPI monitors, we’ll have to rely on software advances to fix these problems. Anti-Aliasing is the next best thing to a world of higher-resolution monitors.

Creating great typeface combinations is an art, not a science. Indeed, the beauty of typography has no borders. While there are no absolute rules to follow, it is crucial that you understand and apply some best practices when combining fonts in a design. When used with diligence and attention, these principles will always yield suitable results. This Smashing Magazine's article takes a close look at some the best practices for combining typefaces — as well as some blunders to avoid.

<a href="https://typographica.org/2010/on-typography/making-geometric-type-work/">Making Geometric Type Work</a>
For graphic designers beginning to experiment in type design, a geometric or modular typeface is a natural starting point. Illustrator and other programs offer a simple collection of elements such as circles, squares, and triangles which can be combined to create a passable alphabet. Dissatisfied with the limits of commercial fonts at the time, this designer twisted and distorted each character to fit into a few simple, very strict rules of construction. Invariably this produced a wide range of exotic letterforms, some more legible that others.

Conceptually, if we deconstruct a font down to its basic elements, we can make use of @font-face for things other than type, icons. Fonts at their most basic molecular level are a series of vector glyphs packaged up into a single “glyph archive”. We can then reference each glyph by its corresponding character code. With this in mind, the glyphs we reference can really be any vector-based single color image.

Trend roundup: Typographic home decor
The best thing about type in print is that it is incredibly versatile — be it small or large scale, blocks of text, single words or single letters, it all looks great in the right context. The same goes for type design in home decor, which explains why there are almost as many great font-related design objects as there are typefaces. This page is a round-up of some pieces of furniture and home accessories that incorporate type in some way.

Typographic Maps
These unique maps accurately depict the streets and highways, parks, neighborhoods, coastlines, and physical features of the city using nothing but type. Only by manually weaving together thousands upon thousands of carefully placed words does the full picture of the city emerge. Every single piece of type was manually placed, a process that took hundreds of hours to complete for each map.
