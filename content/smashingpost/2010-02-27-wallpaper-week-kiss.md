## About the Quote and the Wallpaper

Earlier today, I tweeted a message asking all of my followers about which daily design did they like the best? Out of all the replies, this design got the most compliments. Also, one of my <a href="https://twitter.com/acki">followers</a> suggested that I offer it as a wallpaper which was an excellent idea.

If you are a designer, I'm sure you have heard of this quote. This is one of my favorite design quotes and I always try to apply in when I design. Sure, there are definitely times when my designs are complicated and busy, but really, the designs that I enjoy the most are the ones that are simple and straight to the point. To me, they are the most effective as well. That's why I really like the work of <a href="https://simoncpage.co.uk/blog/">Simon Page</a>.

Also, I definitely applied this quote when doing the redesign of this blog. I stripped away most of the design elements that were unecessary and I tried to make the blog as simple as possible without being bland and boring. You can read more about my redesign process <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/behind-scenes-design-informer-redesign/">here</a>. Anyway, my suggestion to you designers is this.
<blockquote>Keep it simple, stupid!</blockquote>
