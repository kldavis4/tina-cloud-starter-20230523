### Insights From The Designers

<blockquote>"Produced by the design team at <a href="https://www.printerinks.com/">Printerinks</a>. Based in London, England, the design team at Printerinks have endured the rain and cold weather for too long. The inspiration for this icon set came from the need of a lovely warm summer break.

We decided to go for a flat design style to let the bright colours pop. Each individual icon represents what we love about the summer, from travelling to hot countries to BBQ's at home. Our set of 40 contains all the icons you need for your creative app, travel website or blog. "</blockquote>

A big thank you to Printerinks — we sincerely appreciate your time and efforts. Keep up the brilliant work!
