  **JavaScript** is an integral part of the RIA revolution. JavaScript allows
  developers to create rich and interactive web interfaces and establish
  asynchronous communication with servers for constantly up-to-date data without
  a page refresh.

  Many things that were once accomplished using Flash objects can now be built
  using JavaScript - with the added benefit that it is free, typically more web
  and mobile accessible under most circumstances using best practices for
  development techniques, and without the need to use proprietary software for
  development.

  Though JavaScript has been around for a while, new tools, techniques, and
  information are constantly being pumped out to continually push the technology
  into greater heights. In this article, we wish to share with you a **huge list
  of fresh and new tools and resources** that JavaScript developers will find
  useful and informative.

## Useful JavaScript Tools

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://ejohn.org/blog/fireunit/">FireUnit</a>
Unit testing is an integral part of building high-performance and efficient web applications. John Resig (creator of jQuery library) and Jan Odvarko have developed an excellent Firefox/Firebug extension called FireUnit which gives developers logging and testing capabilities via a simple JavaScript API. For those interested in the tool, you should also read Odvarko's post detailing the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.softwareishard.com/blog/firebug/fireunit-testing-in-the-firebug-world/">usage of FireUnit</a>.

[![FireUnit](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/14e9438b-6a0b-4221-9bba-95c5815b5208/fireunit.jpg)](https://ejohn.org/blog/fireunit/)

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://sugartest.scriptia.net/">Sugar Test</a>
SugarTest makes it easy to write elegant and understandable JavaScript tests. Its API is inspired by both RSpec, Shoulda and jQuery. It works as a DSL running on top of JsUnitTest.

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/">JSON Formatter and Validator</a>
The JSON Formatter was created to help with debugging. As data expressed as JSON is often written without line breaks to save space, it became extremely difficult to actually read it. This tool hopes to solve the problem by formatting the JSON into data that is easily readable by human beings.

<span class="removed_link" title="https://icant.co.uk/sandbox/fauxconsole/">Faux Console: Simulating a Firebug, Safari or Opera debugging in IE</span>
Browsers like Safari, Opera and Firefox use the Firebug extension that offers a developer a comfortable way to output debugging information using the console.log() command. Microsoft Internet Explorer does not support this though – Faux Console is a small JavaScript that you can embed in the document to have a basic debugging console in IE.

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://jsbin.com/">JS Bin</a>
JS Bin is a web application for testing and debugging JavaScript and CSS collaboratively.
