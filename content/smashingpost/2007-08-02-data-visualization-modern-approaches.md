Data presentation can be beautiful, elegant and descriptive. There is a variety of conventional ways to visualize data - tables, histograms, pie charts and bar graphs are being used every day, in every project and on every possible occasion. However, to convey a message to your readers effectively, sometimes you need more than just a simple pie chart of your results. In fact, there are much better, profound, creative and absolutely fascinating ways to <a title="Data Visualization and Infographics" href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/01/monday-inspiration-data-visualization-and-infographics/">visualize data</a>. Many of them might become ubiquitous in the next few years. 

So what can we expect? Which <a title="Data Visualization and Infographics Resources" href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/09/25-useful-data-visualization-and-infographics-resources/">innovative ideas</a> are already being used? And what are the most creative approaches to present data in ways we've never thought before?

Let's take a look at the <strong>most interesting modern approaches to data visualization</strong> as well as related articles, resources and tools.</p>

## 1\. Mindmaps

Informationarchitects.jp presents the 200 most successful websites on the web, ordered by category, proximity, success, popularity and perspective in a mindmap. Apparently, web-sites are connected as they've never been before. Quite comprehnsive.</p>

## 2\. Displaying News

Newsmap is an application that visually reflects the constantly changing landscape of the Google News news aggregator. The size of data blocks is defined by their popularity at the moment.

Digg BigSpy arranges popular stories at the top when people digg them. Bigger stories have more diggs.

Digg Stack: Digg stories arrange themselves as stack as users digg them. The more diggs a story gets, the larger is the stack.

## 3\. Displaying Data

Amaztype, a typographic book search, collects the information from Amazon and presents it in the form of keyword you've provided. To get more information about a given book, simply click on it.

Similar idea is being used by Flickrtime. The tool uses Flickr API to present the uploaded images in real-time. The images form the clock which shows the current time.

Time Magazine uses visual hills (spikes) to emphasize the density of American population in its map.

<a href="https://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/92">Hans Rosling TED Talk</a> is a legendary talk of the Swedish professor Hans Rosling, in which he explains a new way of presenting statistical data. His Trendalyzer software (recently acquired by Google) turns complex global trends into lively animations, making decades of data pop. Asian countries, as colorful bubbles, float across the grid -- toward better national health and wealth. Animated bell curves representing national income distribution squish and flatten. In Rosling's hands, global trends -- life expectancy, child mortality, poverty rates - become clear, intuitive and even playful.

Three Views shows three views of the earth, in which each country is represented by a circle that shows the amount of money spent on the military (size of circle) and what fraction of the country's earnings that uses (colour). Compact and beautiful presentation of data.
