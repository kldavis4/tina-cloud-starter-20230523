<strong>Successful product design</strong> manages to reveal useful functionality beyond its appealing form. No matter how excellent a design looks like, most customers aren't likely to spend money on something they won't be able to use. On the other hand, most people are likely to buy something useful <em>despite</em> the design it has.

Yet the key to a truly successful product design lies in designer's ability to combine both beautiful design and functionality making it obvious to the customers how the product can be used and which benefits it delivers. However, one can combine the beauty of design with the utility it is supposed to provide. 

Most products fail to pass this test and never reach the production stage; some products do manage to get to the stores. In the overview below you'll find an overview of some <strong>beautiful and original product designs</strong> which will hopefully make the cut and will be available in the next years. Some of them are already available today.

## Way Out Fridge Magnet

Way Out magnet is an original imitation of the standard exit sign illustrating a run to the fridge for a midnight snack. We, however, are not sure why this sign should actually be placed <em>on</em> the fridge.</p>

## Bracelet Watch

The idea for this watch is classic plastic bracelet, with incorporated lines inside the watch that show the current time. Those three <strong>lines are rotating</strong> around the watch and show the time, while the seconds line is going around all the time. It is a simple concept, atractive and eye-catching. Adjusting the clock

is easy as the watch is the <strong>touchscreen</strong>. All you have to do is to touche the line, click the adjust icon and slide current time line to correct time. Design by Djordje Zivanovic.

## Made in China

This product targets the entire 1.3 billion Chinese population. Each aspect of the hardware derives from an oriental inspiration which improves the PC experience for the targeted market. The hardware features a "No CPU, No Hard drive, No Graphics Card and No Sound Card" concept. These <strong>PC components are stored in a </strong>

Service Provider of the new infrastructure.

Thus, subscribing to a plan of the Service Provider will allow the use of these components. The data from the components is then wirelessly transmitted to the user's hardware. Thus, all PCs are administered by the Service Provider. MADE stands for Massively Administered Digital Entities.

## MARRO computer system

This computer system analyzes, organizes, and customizes daily media activities. It is comprised of a stationary central unit and a separate mobile satellite unit. The central unit contains components such as the media card, CPU, drives and network card. The satellite unit houses the built-in Life OS, CPU, and flash memory.

Compared to the typical OS, which are limited to the resources and hardware of their physical location, the Life OS operates digital files and electronic devices that we use day to day. The MARRO ring records users’ daily media activities within the life system, constantly <strong>learning life patterns</strong> and making suggested improvements.

## External Touch Screen Concept

Wouldn't it be nice if you had an external touch screen that works as a keyboard, macbook cover and a photo/movie stand?

<figure><a href="https://petitinvention.wordpress.com/2008/01/07/external-touch-screen/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/5d6d4f04-d498-4b48-bbdc-5b776b7eae31/32.jpg" alt="Creative Product Designs" width="500" height="500" /></a></figure>

## DDM PC

This concept is supposed to be "integrated device for all" that is easy to use. The "DDM" is normally used as a typical LCD display for a powerful desktop CPU yet can be detached from the main body. In this detached form, the DDM acts much like the desktop PC yet supports portability. In this way, <strong>multiple DDM's can be </strong>

taken away from the main CPU and used separately. When placed back in the CPU cradle, each unit automatically syncs the its data with the local machine's database offering one-step, seemless back-up and sharability.

## Concrete Art

“Concrete Art” is a beautiful way to enhance any room with pretty much any design you can think of. Contrasting the cold austerity of concrete, these floral designs are a great way to enhance any room. This design concept allows for the application of any pattern to the surface, either when pouring or afterwards when the

concrete has set.

## Action Method

The "Action Runner" includes standard 3" x 5" sheet (when ripped), and keeps you focused on Action Steps with the elegance of the silky and sexy covers and blended paper. This ultra matt finish is spiced up with an ultra glossy UV varnish.

## Slice Computing System

The ‘Slice’ concept is an organically inspired computing system which envisions a new approach to accessing, organizing and interacting with information and data stored on the PC. Current file management systems force users to store and manage files in a hierarchy of folders. The files are buried deep within folders providing no

visual indication of where files are located, further adding to the confusion.

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/6fccda36-073e-430a-857d-caf1cd2f35a2/9.jpg" alt="Creative Product Designs" width="500" height="375" /></figure>

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/87d3f6a6-2388-45a8-bb4c-8302b56d48b8/9-2.jpg" alt="Creative Product Designs" width="500" height="375" /></figure>

Slice brings the information out of the computer putting it into the users hand. By <strong>physically interacting with the slice</strong>, users can organize and place files accordingly. Each of the slices visually represent different folders seen in current operating software such as My Documents, My Music, My Videos, etc. The visual and touch based experience associated with slice provides the user with a tangible connection to their information stored on the computer reassuring the safety and placement of their files.

## Concept Cell Phone

In times wenn all-rounder-phones dominate the market, more subtle, intuitive and minimalistic designs provide a sound alternative. This is just a <strong>cell phone to provide communication</strong>. No mp3, no video or camera etc. Designed by Tamer Koseli.

## Rocking Chair

A concept and a modern interpretation of a <strong>rocking chair</strong>. The near circular form seen from the side is what makes the design unique. It allows for the rocking motion without being an attachment, but instead flowing into the rest of the chair. The upper part features a light source, which can be used as a reading light.

## Airtrav

Airtrav is an <strong>electronic boarding pass concept</strong>. The touch screen interface allows for users to access airport information. Travelers can know anything and everything about their flight, dual headphones are available for multiple users and the deaf or hearing impaired can stay alert to important changes. The system has a stackable charging system (charged by an alternative power source).

## Peanut Butter

This is a design we've all been waiting for a loooong time now. The Easy PB&amp;J Jar is a <strong>jar with two lids</strong> that allows you to access all of your peanut butter easily without having to resort to breaking open the jar. As you near the end on one side, simply flip the jar over to get the rest. The straight and smooth internal walls also ensure that no peanut butter is ever left behind a nook or cranny like existing jars.

## Carry On Luggage

A carry-on luggage to articulate the lost romance of air travel. The design also pulls from the golden age of ocean liners: the black lacquered finish will become beautifully scraped and chipped as the suitcase travels with you, revealing the bamboo plywood beneath. The patina will develop with each trip you take. Designed by Joey Roth.

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a36fb6eb-a3ee-403b-9810-0d20a75f4407/33.jpg" alt="Creative Product Designs" /></figure>

## Nokia 888

In Nokia 888 form follows you: it is a light personal mobile communication device. You can <strong>change its form</strong> according to your needs during the day. You dont have to carry it in your pocket or on your wrist. You can carry it anywhere, in any form. You can roll it, bend it, put on your clothes like a clip.

It also makes some form changes that makes it more ergonomical: i.e. when you want to talk on the phone, the body form turns into the form of the good old telephone. You can personalize these forms and record them. Communication takes place via electronical motions that 888 has. E.g. you can send a heart shape to your girlfriend, so her telephone turns into an icon of heart.</p>

## Zeed+

Zeed+ is a computer which maximizes the <strong>mobility of its hardware components</strong>. All the hardware, such as the video card, sound card, CPU and network card are no longer located inside the box. Instead, each of the stem-shaped devices are well packaged standard units that sit on the vase base.

p&gt;Zeed+ has the meaning of <strong>when you need something, you seed something</strong>. Each stem, or "zeed", can be easily upgraded or changed, since they are located outside of the vase base. This also offers the benefit of trading or recylcing old "zeeds" to different market segments. Under the "zeed++" project, the older, but still usable zeeds, can be collected and reused in other Zeed+ computers for special groups, charities, education.

p&gt;The overall design concept of the form is inspired by "Ikebana", the Japanese traditional art of formal flower arrangement with special regard shown to balance, harmony, and form.</p>

## Virtual Ideas Watch

Slick, compact, beautiful and elegant watch design by Julien Soret.

## Bello Concept PMP

Ryan Han has developed a concept with an interesting conceptual feature. The standard finger clicks, swipes and flicks are all incorporated, but the most interesting features involve utilizing shaking and pouring motions.

## Printer Table

For those of us cursed with limited space, this is the answer. It's a combination printer and table that blends in well with small offices as furniture. The faux drawers are actually paper loading trays and the slit is where your prints come out. Now nobody will scold you for setting your drink on top of the printer. Designer: Lukas Koh.

## Onyx Concept

A next-generation phone concept, Onyx. Enabled through Synaptics clear, capacitive sensing technology, Onyx illustrates the future of mobile communications by combining an <strong>intelligent and adaptive user interface</strong> with sleek industrial design and next-generation user interaction design. The Onyx concept does not base its experience on treating applications as separate windows or entities that work in isolation.

Rather, the Onyx concept seamlessly integrates functions into activity based experiences.

## Aquarium Sink

Moody is not only a simple washbasin, but also an aquarium for goldfish, a Zen garden or a simple pebble river bed or whatever you would like it to be. It is completely watertight with a sand bed for fish, and provides the necessary lighting for maintaining your fish in healthy conditions. Price: $4,700.00.

## Pixel Perfect Hour Glass

Designer Pavel Balykin believes that retro timepiece is on schedule for a comeback. It’s fittingly called the <strong>Sand+Time Watch</strong> and has the distinct feature of a digital hour glass screen saver mode. It’s a “screen saver” mode, because this particular feature does not actually count time for you.

## Nokia 888

In Nokia 888 form follows you: it is a light personal mobile communication device. You can <strong>change its form</strong> according to your needs during the day. You dont have to carry it in your pocket or on your wrist. You can carry it anywhere, in any form. You can roll it, bend it, put on your clothes like a clip.

It also makes some form changes that makes it more ergonomical: i.e. when you want to talk on the phone, the body form turns into the form of the good old telephone. You can personalize these forms and record them. Communication takes place via electronical motions that 888 has. E.g. you can send a heart shape to your girlfriend, so her telephone turns into an icon of heart.</p>

## Zeed+

Zeed+ is a computer which maximizes the <strong>mobility of its hardware components</strong>. All the hardware, such as the video card, sound card, CPU and network card are no longer located inside the box. Instead, each of the stem-shaped devices are well packaged standard units that sit on the vase base.

p&gt;Zeed+ has the meaning of <strong>when you need something, you seed something</strong>. Each stem, or "zeed", can be easily upgraded or changed, since they are located outside of the vase base. This also offers the benefit of trading or recylcing old "zeeds" to different market segments. Under the "zeed++" project, the older, but still usable zeeds, can be collected and reused in other Zeed+ computers for special groups, charities, education.

p&gt;The overall design concept of the form is inspired by "Ikebana", the Japanese traditional art of formal flower arrangement with special regard shown to balance, harmony, and form.</p>

## Bello Concept PMP

Ryan Han has developed a concept with an interesting conceptual feature. The standard finger clicks, swipes and flicks are all incorporated, but the most interesting features involve utilizing shaking and pouring motions.

## Printer Table

For those of us cursed with limited space, this is the answer. It's a combination printer and table that blends in well with small offices as furniture. The faux drawers are actually paper loading trays and the slit is where your prints come out. Now nobody will scold you for setting your drink on top of the printer. Designer: Lukas Koh.

## Pixel Perfect Hour Glass

Designer Pavel Balykin believes that retro timepiece is on schedule for a comeback. It’s fittingly called the <strong>Sand+Time Watch</strong> and has the distinct feature of a digital hour glass screen saver mode. It’s a “screen saver” mode, because this particular feature does not actually count time for you.

If you want to know the real time, click a button and a more modern interpretation of time, we like to call “numbers”, will appear. Add a motion sensor, like the one used in Apple’s iPhone, and this screen saver mode might get that extra little cool factor to push it into production.</p>

## Circle Sofa

The Circle sofa unit is made up of four parts, two of which make up a semicircle; all of which together create a round sculpture. The outline and contour looks highly sculptural and vigorous - and it is left open how one arranges these sofas in a room. Due to the "segmentation" of the circle, the sofas facilitate a great diversity of options and multifunctional solutions as well as interesting sculptural forms and lines. Designed by UN Studio, Amsterdam (Ben van Berkel).</p>

## The Bulbdial Clock

The Bulbdial Clock has no hands — just one pole in the center of the clock, and three light sources of varying heights which revolve around the pole casting shadows. In the model illustrated above, the light sources are each attached to a <strong>ring which rotates around the pole</strong>. The innermost ring rotates once per minute, casting a “second hand” shadow. The middle ring rotates once per hour, and casts the “minute hand” shadow. And the outer ring rotates once every 12 hours, casting the “little hand” shadow.
