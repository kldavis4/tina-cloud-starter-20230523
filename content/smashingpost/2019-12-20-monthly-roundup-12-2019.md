With the year slowly coming to an end, now is probably a great time to slow down and be mindful. Look back, reflect, breathe. It‚Äôs been a long year for all of us, so why not make yourself a good cuppa coffee or tea (whatever your preference is, there are other options, of course), and think about what your personal highlights were and set out some hopes and goals for the upcoming year to come.

## Best Picks From Our Newsletter

We‚Äôll be honest: Every second week, we struggle with keeping the [Smashing Newsletter](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-smashing-newsletter/) issues at a moderate length &mdash; there are just *so* many talented folks out there working on brilliant projects! So, without wanting to make this monthly update too long either, we‚Äôre shining the spotlight on the following projects:

**Note**: *A thank you to [Cosima Mielke](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/cosima-mielke/) for writing and preparing these posts!*

### Web Almanac 2019

<p>Take data processed from nearly 6 million websites and 85 people volunteering countless hours planning, researching, and writing &mdash; that‚Äôs what it took to create the 2019 edition of the <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2019/">Web Almanac</a>, HTTP Archive‚Äôs annual state of the web report.</p>

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2019/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/de013a9e-8f1e-48b7-992d-1a586e7744e1/hero-js-comic-almanac.png" sizes="100vw" caption="(<a href='https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2019/'>Source</a>)" alt="Illustration showing little characters made up of geometrical forms painting a website." >}}

<p>The report consists of 20 chapters spanning aspects of page content, user experience, publishing, and distribution to shine a light on the current state of the ever-evolving network of technology that the open web is. A great resource to become more aware of current best practices.</p>

### How To Read A WebPage Test Waterfall Chart

<p>Do you have difficulties reading WebPageTest waterfall charts? You‚Äôre not alone, it can be quite a challenge to remember the details and what they all mean. To freshen up your knowledge, Matt Hobbs collected all the many bits of information in a <a href="https://nooshu.github.io/blog/2019/10/02/how-to-read-a-wpt-waterfall-chart/">single blog post</a> that we all can refer to.</p>

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://nooshu.github.io/blog/2019/10/02/how-to-read-a-wpt-waterfall-chart/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/653875b6-d97d-469e-af79-6db1d76f7042/request-1-annotated.png" sizes="100vw" caption="(<a href='https://nooshu.github.io/blog/2019/10/02/how-to-read-a-wpt-waterfall-chart/'>Source</a>)" alt="WebPageTest timeline and chart" >}}

<p>The post explains the basic layout of the waterfall chart, what each of the colored vertical lines means, and what metrics the horizontal blocks refer to. It also lists common patterns that you might stumble upon in a waterfall chart. One for the bookmarks.</p>

### Open-Source Illustrations Kit

<p>100-day challenges are a wonderful opportunity to dive deep into a topic or craft and evolve and improve with each day. Back in 2016, Vijay Verma spent almost two hours a day for 100 days designing, illustrating, and experimenting to get himself to the next level of illustration.</p>

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://illlustrations.co/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0fad9a77-d9d9-4cf4-b5ec-cd2c1eda00b9/illlustrations-snapshot-large.png" sizes="100vw" caption="(<a href='https://illlustrations.co/'>Source</a>)" alt="A screenshot of open-source illustrations available" >}}

<p>After living on a harddrive untouched since then, Vijay now decided to release the illustrations as a free <a href="https://illlustrations.co/">open-source illustrations kit</a> so you can use them for your landing pages, mobile apps, presentations, or whatever else comes to your mind. Available in AI, SVG, PNG, and EPS formats. Thank you, Vijay, for sharing!</p>

### 30 Days Of Code Tidbits

<p>Who doesn‚Äôt love a bite-sized tip? One that doesn‚Äôt take long to swallow but teaches you something new to instantly ease your life as a developer? Using the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/samantha_ming/status/1201223452201381888">#codetidbits30</a> on Twitter, Samantha Ming posts a new coding tidbit every day in December.</p>

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://twitter.com/samantha_ming/status/1206296421491601409" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/af61aad5-3e81-4c8d-9bec-b0f57b4aefbf/samantha-ming-merging-arrays.jpg" sizes="100vw" caption="(<a href='https://twitter.com/samantha_ming/status/1206296421491601409'>Source</a>)" alt="Code tidbit explaining how to merge arrays" >}}

<p>Three ways to remove array duplicates, a little trick to style elements that have no children or text at all, and a solution for displaying your data in your browser dev tools, these are only some of the tips in the series. Covering JavaScript, HTML, and CSS snippets, #codetidbits30 is a true treasure chest of front-end goodies. Be sure to follow along. </p>

### Scaling SVGs Made Simple

<p>Scaling <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> elements can be a daunting task, since they act very differently than normal images. Amelia Wattenberger came up with an <a href="https://wattenberger.com/guide/scaling-svg">ingenious comparison</a> to help us make sense of SVGs and their special features: ‚ÄúThe <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> element is a <em>telescope into another world</em>.‚Äù</p>

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://wattenberger.com/guide/scaling-svg" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d502d03f-81ce-4f31-92ca-589c074d7075/wattenberger-scaling-svg.png" sizes="100vw" caption="(<a href='https://wattenberger.com/guide/scaling-svg'>Source</a>)" alt="A person looking through a telescope watching a star shape" >}}

<p>Based on the idea of the telescope, Amelia explains how to use the <code>viewBox</code> property to zoom in or out with your ‚Äútelescope‚Äù, and, thus, change the size of your <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code>. A small tip that works wonders. </p>

### Recreating Print Layouts With CSS

<p>When it comes to creative layouts, magazines are an endless source of inspiration. And thanks to CSS Grid, there‚Äôs nothing to hold you back from bringing more sophisticated layouts to the web, too.</p>

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://www.dan-davies.co.uk/print-to-css" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d563555f-aa74-4446-bd2e-d8089c998260/dan-davies-print-to-css.png" sizes="100vw" caption="(<a href='https://www.dan-davies.co.uk/print-to-css'>Source</a>)" alt="Layout for an article abou the Dutch soccer player Virgil Van Dijk" >}}

<p>Inspired by magazine layouts, their use of typography and their structures, Dan Davies took on the challenge to recreate some of the print work he liked on the web. The result is an awe-inspiring <a href="https://www.dan-davies.co.uk/print-to-css">collection of nine layouts</a> that use the potential of CSS Grid to its fullest. Beautifully art-directed and responsive, they are great examples of pushing the limits of what‚Äôs possible on the web layout-wise. </p>

### Web Performance Vs. User Engagement

<p>It‚Äôs no secret that performance can have a positive impact on user engagement and, in effect, improve conversion. To find out how performance correlates to conversion for their product, the team at Vrbo implemented an automated process that shows the connection between business events and performance data.</p>

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://medium.com/expedia-group-tech/web-performance-vs-user-engagement-7eda84f6436b" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/62c24d3f-6ac7-42b0-8e0f-cd2c74cfe058/web-performance-vs-user-engagement.png" sizes="100vw" caption="(<a href='https://medium.com/expedia-group-tech/web-performance-vs-user-engagement-7eda84f6436b'>Source</a>)" alt="A screenshot of the holy grail dashboard created at Vrbo" >}}

<p>Carlos Moro from Vrbo now shares a <a href="https://medium.com/expedia-group-tech/web-performance-vs-user-engagement-7eda84f6436b">case study</a> in which he gives more insights into the approach, as well as handy tips for measuring site performance, user engagement, and putting the two into relation to one another. Interesting. </p>

### Time-Travel-Debugging For The Web

<p>An early Firefox DevTools experiment that is worth keeping an eye on is <a href="https://firefox-replay.com/">Web Replay</a>. Web Replay records your actions so you can track bugs down faster and understand your code better &mdash; a collaborative time-travel debugging instrument, so to say.</p>

{{< rimg href="https://firefox-replay.com/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c843f84c-0a28-4e97-b959-595139f04ab7/firefox-hero-replay.png" sizes="100vw" caption="(<a href='https://firefox-replay.com/'>Source</a>)" alt="Replay in Firefox DevTools" >}}

<p>The replaying process preserves all the same JS behavior, DOM structures, graphical updates, and most other behavior that occurred while recording. Want to give it a try? Replay is already available in Firefox Nightly for macOS (still disabled by default until it is more stable, but you can <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/WebReplay">turn it on manually</a>). Handy! </p>

### Commit-Message-Driven Development

<p>Have you ever considered to write the commit message before you start writing the code? Sven Hofmann does it this way, and now he explains <a href="https://hofmannsven.com/2019/commit-message-driven-development">why you could give it a try</a>, too.</p>

{{< rimg href="https://hofmannsven.com/2019/commit-message-driven-development" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/b3b32ed8-b6e0-4c83-a8a9-8c703bee5ea8/commit-message-driven-development.png" sizes="100vw" caption="(<a href='https://hofmannsven.com/2019/commit-message-driven-development'>Source</a>)" alt="Bash functions incorporating commit-message-driven development into a developer‚Äôs workflow." >}}

<p>We all know those vague and messy commit messages like ‚Äúbugfixes and minor improvements‚Äù that aren‚Äôt helpful in the long term &mdash; especially if you‚Äôre working with a team or on an open-source project. The commit-message-driven workflow that Sven suggests could help change that: first, you write the commit message, then the code, then you commit. Having the scope of the task nailed down in advance, gives each commit a precise goal that you can focus on and that makes it easier to review your commits later on. Clever!</p>

### Dealing With Ads In 2020

<p>Ads are a two-sided sword: nobody really likes them but a lot of sites depend on them to generate revenue. Working for a news company that is dependent on ads, Christian Schaefer wanted to find ways to minimize their impact and make them less annoying. Now he <a href="https://schepp.dev/posts/ad-integration-in-2020/">summarized his approach</a> in a comprehensive blog post.</p>

{{< rimg href="https://schepp.dev/posts/ad-integration-in-2020/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e46497c3-e9f2-428d-956c-ed15d23f690d/lord-of-the-rings-mordor-mount-doom-eye-of-sauron-resized.jpg" sizes="100vw" caption="(<a href='https://schepp.dev/posts/ad-integration-in-2020/'>Source</a>)" alt="Screenshot from the ‚ÄúDealing with Ads in 2020‚Äù blog post" >}}

<p>The post shares valuable insights into how Christian and his team developed a generic solution to transform and combine mobile and desktop ad code into one responsive ad loading code, how they improved performance by lazy loading the ads, what they did to prevent the ads from breaking the site‚Äôs layout, and some other things that add up to bringing the front end into a much better position when dealing with ads. Great tips for everyone who finds themselves wrangling ads. </p>
