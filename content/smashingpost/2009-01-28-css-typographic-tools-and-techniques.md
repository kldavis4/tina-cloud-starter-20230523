A lot of great websites out there have beautiful typography using only CSS. But simply looking at them gives you only half the picture. This post showcases examples of good clean typography using nothing but CSS, and it explains what the designers did to achieve this beautiful type.

[![Useful Typographic Tools](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/50d8d306-17ae-43ca-8305-9a152d8e7270/typographictools13.jpg)](https://www.3point7designs.com/blog/2008/06/02/10-examples-of-beautiful-css-typography-and-how-they-did-it/)

typeface.js
With typeface.js, you can embed custom fonts on your Web pages so that you don’t have to render text as images. What makes it different is that it’s JavaScript only, not JavaScript <em>and</em> Flash like <a href="https://www.mikeindustries.com/sifr">sIFR</a>, or JavaScript and PHP like FLIR. So, instead of creating images or using Flash just to show your website’s text in the font you want, you can use typeface.js and write in plain HTML and CSS, just as though your visitors had the font installed locally.  It’s pretty easy to use: load the typeface.js library and some typeface.js fonts, then proceed as normal.

![Useful Typographic Tools](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/325d4a7e-634f-4744-b68a-ca49c889e33e/typographictools2.jpg)

Facelift Image Replacement (FLIR)
Facelift Image Replacement (FLIR) is an image replacement script that dynamically generates image representations of text on your Web page in fonts that otherwise might not be visible to your visitors. The generated image is automatically inserted into your Web page via JavaScript and is visible in all modern browsers. Any element with text can be replaced, from headers (&lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, etc.) to &lt;span&gt; elements and everything in between! FLIR is SEO-friendly and only renders an image if JavaScript is enabled on the user’s browser. If you are using WordPress for your blog, you might find <a href="https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/facelift-image-replacement/">this plug-in</a> useful to easily apply FLIR to your Web pages.

<a href="https://artypapers.com/csshelppile/pcdtr/">P+C DTR</a>

The technique is currenty unavailable for download.

<a href="https://www.3point7designs.com/blog/2006/09/20/advanced-typography-techniques-using-css/">Advanced Typography Techniques Using CSS</a>
While descriptions and basic uses of CSS typography controls have been beaten to death, many rich typographic capabilities of CSS are still not well documented. This post is a great example of what you can do by combining and tweaking type using CSS. Different techniques are introduced: reflections, drop characters, handwriting, newspaper headlines and more.

[![Useful Typographic Tools](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/58b5505f-7600-49e9-9432-f11dd368523a/typographictools16.jpg)](https://www.3point7designs.com/blog/2006/09/20/advanced-typography-techniques-using-css/)

<a href="https://www.webdesignerwall.com/tutorials/typographic-contrast-flow/">Typographic Contrast and Flow</a>
Typographic contrast is important because not every piece of content on a page has the same weight: some have greater significance than others. By creating contrast, you direct the reader’s attention to the important messages and also enhance visual appeal. Here are seven basic methods for creating typographic contrast, using size, typeface, color, case, style/decoration, weight and space.

## 5\. Hyphenation

<a href="https://www.plazoo.com/en/tools.asp">OnLine Hyphenation</a>
This tool takes care of automatic Automatic hyphenation for texts and sites. The tool uses <code>&amp;shy;</code> and inserts hyphens in the right places to make the justified text look readable. The tool is a little bit buggy and not perfect, but is still useful.

<a href="https://code.google.com/p/hyphenator/">Hyphenator</a>
Hyphenator.js brings client-side hyphenation of HTML documents to every browser by inserting soft hyphens using hyphenation patterns and Frank M. Liang’s hyphenation algorithm commonly known from LaTeX and OpenOffice. The goal is to provide hyphenation in all browsers that support JavaScript and the soft hyphen for at least English, German and French. <a href="https://yellowgreen.de/hyphenation-in-web/">Here is the server-side script that does the hyphenation</a>.</p>

## 6\. sIFR

<a href="https://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/sifr/">sIFR 2.0: Rich Accessible Typography for the Masses</a>
sIFR (or Scalable Inman Flash Replacement) is a technology that allows you to replace text elements on the page with Flash equivalents. It uses JavaScript to target certain text page elements and replace them with Flash, which results in the same text but rendered in a new font. This means you are free to use any font you wish in your design, instead of being limited to a very small set of “safe” Web fonts.  sIFR is easier to implement than any other image replacement technique. Instead of manually generating each header with an image editor, you’re able to skip the editor completely.

[![Useful Typographic Tools](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ec24b30d-919e-41f3-ad54-9f761b5f6d52/typographictools20.jpg)](https://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/sifr/)

<a href="https://www.allcrunchy.com/Web_Stuff/sIFR_lite/">sIFR lite</a>
A solution similar to the original sIFR package, but smaller (3.7 Kb) than the original (22 Kb) and including even more nifty features. It auto-detects the color of text elements, is completely object-oriented, doesn’t use CSS selectors and targets elements by tag name and class.

sIFRvault
A repository of sIFR fonts, rated, tagged and available for download. Users can submit their SWF-files as well. Please notice that you need to respect all copyright and licensing laws - some of the featured fonts appear to be commercial (via <a href="https://www.twitter.com/chrisjlee">chrisjlee</a>).

![Useful Typographic Tools](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/5018bfad-1bc5-4bd6-9be7-10e98d7d85a4/type-15.jpg)

<a href="https://jquery.thewikies.com/sifr/">jQuery sIFR Plugin</a>
The jQuery sIFR Plugin is an add-on for jQuery that makes it easy to replace text on a Web page with Flash text (sIFR). The jQuery sIFR Plugin does all the work of figuring out the text, files, sizes, colors and any other configuration needed to convert text to a beautiful sIFR font, with consistent behavior across all major browsers.

<a href="https://webdesign.maratz.com/lab/multi_color_sifr/">Multi color sIFR 2.0.1</a>
This version of sIFR supports <code>strong</code>, <code>em</code> and <code>span</code>-elements and can color parts of the headline in colors.

[![Useful Typographic Tools](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d6feaec1-53f8-4333-99a3-30be3d77ee64/type-20.gif)](https://webdesign.maratz.com/lab/multi_color_sifr/)

<a href="https://www.sifrgenerator.com/">sIFR Generator</a>
The big disadvantage of sIFR is that creating sIFR files is a tedious task that also requires Adobe Flash Studio in order to create a .swf file with the font of your choice. At least, that was the big disadvantage until now. sIFR Generator is an online tool that allows you to create sIFR .swf files with a few clicks of your mouse. Simply upload the TTF font of the font you want to convert, preview and download.</p>

## 7\. Grids

<a href="https://css-tricks.com/typographic-grid/">Typographic Grid</a>
If your website is heavy with text content, you will need to pay attention to the underlying grid. Check out Typography Grid, created recently by Chris Coyier: “I was just screwing around with typography and getting things to line up according to a strict horizontal and vertical grid. It was inspired by the <a href="https://24ways.org/2006/compose-to-a-vertical-rhythm">Compose to a Vertical Rhythm</a> article by Richard Rutter a few years ago, except uses <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2006/02/08/unitless-line-heights/">unitless line height</a>.” Check out the demo <a href="https://css-tricks.com/examples/TypographicGrid">here</a>.

<a href="https://grid.mindplay.dk">Grid Designer</a>
Anyone looking for a little help to get going with grid design should look at this handy tool. Grid Designer 2 lets you set variables for your layout, such as the number of columns, the width in pixels, gutters and margins. You can also set variables for the typography, so that you can control the size, weight, line height and other variables for your paragraphs and titles. After you set up your desired layout, all you have to do is export the CSS to use in your own design.
