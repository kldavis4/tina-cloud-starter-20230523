## About The Book

Responsive design is a default these days, but we are all still figuring out just the right process and techniques to better craft responsive websites. That’s why we created a new book — to **gather practical techniques and strategies** from people who have learned how to get things done right, in actual projects with actual real-world challenges.

{{% feature-panel %}}

Just like all of our _Smashing Books_, the book **isn't concerned with trends** or short-lived workarounds. It focuses on the actual **design process** — the _why_ of the decisions we make as we craft websites. Think of it as a reliable playbook for issues that keep popping up in every responsive project — just the playbook you need to master all the **tricky facets and hurdles** of responsive design.</p>

Yet, these problems are often quite tricky and complex, and the context of these problems requires us to be creative and flexible in our workflows. With responsive design, we are prompted to create scalable design systems that work well in unpredictable environments. To do that, we need to be pragmatic and find solutions that work well within given constraints. That’s why we created this book: to find techniques that have actually worked in real-life projects with <strong>real-world challenges</strong>.</p>

What about the behaviour of web forms, navigation, mega-drop down menus, filters? Can we utilize vertical media queries and portrait/landscape orientation change? In this chapter, Vitaly will provide an overview of clever practical techniques for improving UX of responsive sites, with innovative approaches to designing "responsive modules" such as mega-drop downs, tables, calendars, accordions, maps, sliders, responsive PDF and responsive iconography — and a dash of anti-patterns to avoid as well.</p>

<p class="desc"><span class="lead">Summary</span> <span>&bull;</span> By default, web fonts block rendering, hiding content from the user. The only way to make content accessible as soon as possible is by <strong>treating web fonts as a progressive enhancement</strong>. This doesn’t mean web font performance is not an issue. You still need to load web fonts as quickly as possible so that users experience your site exactly how you designed and built it. Let's fix this.<br /><br />In this chapter, Bram shares insights that he has learned from working at <em>Typekit</em>, covering web fonts and formats, font loading and font rendering, CSS Font Loading API, fallback fonts, caching, compression, inlining, subsetting and font loading strategies.</p>

Perhaps a Retina image (only) to Retina screens, or an art-directed image to small screens, or a portrait image for portrait orientation, or perhaps .webp to browsers supporting the format — without performance hits. Since images are the heaviest assets on the web, dealing with them intelligently is both our responsibility and opportunity for more dynamic layouts. That's what native responsive images are for.<br /><br />In this chapter, Yoav discusses the different responsive images use cases and how we can use the native solution today to create performant responsive websites.
