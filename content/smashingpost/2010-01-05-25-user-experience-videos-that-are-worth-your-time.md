  Jesse James Garett, founder of Adaptive Path and author of the book The
  Elements of User Experience, speaks on what UX and UX design is, what UX
  looked like before and what are some of the challenges people are encountering
  now. He cites engagement as the main goal of UX design and, through some
  fantastic examples, shows that engagement is an **universal quality** achieved
  through visuality, sound, touch, smell, taste, body and mind. One of the most
  impressive moments from the session is when Jesse compares Beethoven to an
  experience designer, accompanied by the Ninth Symphony.

We're all mostly accustomed to educating ourselves by reading articles. Rare are the opportunities to attend conferences or watch live shows on subjects that we're interested in. That's why we are presenting here phenomenal videos and related resources on the topic of <strong>user experience</strong> (UX) by different presenters at different events. We have focused on current content but have included some older videos that are still relevant. It will take you more than <strong>16 hours to watch</strong> all of these videos. So, make some popcorn, turn off the lights and enjoy.

<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/billder/learning-ixd-from-everyday-objects">Learning IxD from Everyday Objects</a>
"Inspiration surrounds us in everyday objects." This is how Bill DeRouchey begins this brilliant talk about interaction design. We use icons, words or shapes to create a language of interactions. If we use the wrong language, the interaction becomes confusing, and this is what Bill shows, using many common objects and devices. One of the most interesting slides is the one that shows how users "hack the interface." Duration: 45 minutes.

<a href="https://videos.visitmix.com/MIX09/C10F">Design Prototyping: Bringing Wireframes to Life</a>
Dan Harrelson explains the purpose of prototyping, why it is important and how it differs from wireframes and visual comps. With wireframing, instead of seeing how a concept functions or works, we see how it actually feels, which contributes to better usability testing. The video, like all videos from MIX 09, has "double view": while looking at the large slides, you have a synchronized inset video of the speaker. Duration: 60 minutes.

<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/jmspool/journey-to-the-center-of-design">Journey to the Center of Design</a>
Does user-centric design really exist? In this funny keynote, Jared Spool asks whether user-centric design (UCD) has lost its way and needs to evolve into something else.

<a href="https://vimeo.com/6712657">10/GUI</a>

Although keyboard and mouse were really great innovations in past century, Clayton Miller think we shouldn't stop there but rather innovate further. Duration: 8 minutes.
