<a href="https://software.sil.org/andika/">Andika Basic</a> (only Thin is available for free)
Andika is a sans serif, Unicode-compliant font designed especially for literacy use, taking into account the needs of beginning readers.

Released under the Open Font License.

The font has round corners and subtle chamfers, which are all but invisible at text sizes, but add an upbeat, irreverent expression at display sizes (<em>via Chris Apalodimas</em>).

<a href="https://www.ripetype.com.au/?p=48">Ripe</a>
Ripe was designed to be a practical typeface. Each character is distinct, yet consistent.

CP Mono Beta
The Font is a mono spaced and caps-only (as the original) with weights from thin to black. As a typographic experiment, every character should fit in the same square, vertically too. Diacritics and ascenders had to come down and later, when I decided to add lower case letters, descenders up. A variant with shortened descenders became a stylistic set and another set straightens angles in letters like A, K or V (via <a href="https://imjustcreative.com/cp-mono-beta-free-typeface-for-immediate-download/2009/06/06/">imjustcreative</a>).
