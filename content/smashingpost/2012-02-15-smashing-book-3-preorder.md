## What’s In The Smashing Book 3?

Unlike its predecessors, the new Smashing Book #3 has a theme: <em>Redesign</em>. It is a professional guide on how to redesign websites and it also introduces a whole new mindset for progressive Web design. In this ever-changing Web design industry, the book challenges you to think differently about your work and will change the way you design websites forever.

## Extra Book: Smashing Book #3⅓ — The Extension

Our <strong>authors have turned out to be much more productive than we anticipated</strong> and have produced more exciting chapters than one book could handle. Adding these chapters to the book would have increased its size and weight — and, hence, shipping cost — substantially.

Not wanting to withhold these chapters, we have decided to release them separately. We are proud to present an extra book, <em>Smashing Book #3⅓ — The Extension</em>, filled with four additional chapters of quick quality reading!

With Web design, we can do much more than inform the audience. The power of storytelling and content strategy is in creating engaging, emotional connections that transcend their platforms. In this book, we will review emerging navigation design patterns and understand how to employ a content strategy — which is an important process, often underestimated and dependent on many factors. A case study of Smashing Magazine’s responsive redesign beautifully illustrates what this approach could look like in practice.

## Why The Theme Of Redesign?

The reason is simple. In recent years, the Web has changed a <em>lot</em>. The Web designer’s tools now are advanced, and browsers are highly capable. Designers have established clever coding and design techniques, and they are facing new challenges and embracing new technologies. These changes are fundamental and require us to <strong>reconsider how we approach Web design</strong>. It’s time to rethink and reinvent: it is time to redesign the Web.

But are we all prepared for this? How does responsive design fit into your workflow? What UX and mobile techniques do you follow when designing websites? And if you have a redesign project on the horizon, how do you approach it and work your way through it? This is what the Smashing Book #3 is all about: it explains what you need to know to create effective websites today, and what you need to know to be prepared for the future.</p>

## Exclusive Artwork and Design

The Smashing Book series has gotten a rather eye-catching facelift. The well-respected Belgian artist <a href="https://veerle.duoh.com/">Veerle Pieters</a> has taken on the significant task of putting together an innovative, bold cover design. And the result is bold indeed. Veerle’s styling of Smashing Magazine’s “S” reflects the many aspects that make up a Web designer’s workflow today.</p>

<figure class="fwi"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7ee1210a-9dfb-4f5f-bd17-20f02e9d8e1d/veerle1.png" alt="Early Scribbles of the Cover Design" /></figure>

<figure class="fwi"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/b9310ada-967e-4871-90a2-acad85298a46/veerle2.jpg" alt="Cover Design in a zoomed-in detailed view" /><br>

If you have Smashing Books 1 and 2, you’ll know that animals play a distinct role — forming almost a tradition for the series. This time, we have asked the talented young illustrator <a href="https://www.katemclelland.co.uk/">Kate McLelland</a> to illustrate the introductory pages for all of the chapters. Kate has been impressively creative in her designs; the theme of redesign has obviously shaped the tone of her artwork. Each chapter begins with an elaborate drop cap.</p>

<figure class="fwi"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/6e3ea84c-533f-469c-87b3-7bf52d088666/s-letter.png" alt="The letter S: A detail of a chapter illustration, designed by Kate McLelland." /><br>
<figcaption>A detail of a chapter illustration, designed by Kate McLelland.</figcaption></figure>

Each illustration employs a different metaphor that relates to the accompanying chapter. Try to see what they all are once you get your hands on the book. Appropriately enough, when strung together, the drop caps spell out “Redesign the Web.” The composite style of the illustrations reflects how so many components have to come together for a successful redesign.
