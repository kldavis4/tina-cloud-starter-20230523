By the way, it's been two years since <a href="https://www.facebook.com/smashmag">Smashing Magazine's Facebook fan page</a> launched (now with 18,500 fans). We have worked hard to integrate discussions, useful tips and give-aways to make the fan page more appealing and engaging.</p>

## Showcase Of Well-Designed Facebook Fan Pages

### Giants of the Industry

Big brands demonstrate the best use of Facebook by far. Getting millions of fans may not seem like a big deal for Coca-Cola or Victoria’s Secret, but these companies managed to create fan pages that engage users on a much deeper level than by just asking them to click the “Like” button. An interesting trend seen across this category is of large companies taking Facebook to a new level, putting it at the center not only of their social media campaign, but of their entire online presence.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Starbucks">Starbucks</a>
Currently with the number one fan page for a brand on Facebook (with almost 8 million fans), Starbucks takes a distinctive approach, focusing less on loud entertaining apps and more on high-quality content and beneficial offers for its fans. Starbucks has learned how to effectively use status updates and how to share a lot of interesting, useful and engaging material aside from its product updates. The company also offers a couple of interactive apps that not only are fun (e.g. the Instant Story tab) but that offer tangible benefits (e.g. discount coupons, and functionality that allows fans to manage their Starbucks accounts right in Facebook). The fan page also has an interactive map that links to the company’s regional Facebook pages (just as BlackBerry does, as we'll see). With no unusual visual indicators on its fan page, Starbucks demonstrates that functionality is at least as important as aesthetics.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Starbucks"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="77" title="starbucks" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/deb56d9c-2118-47a3-9cc2-c04ab61c1526/starbucks.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="439" /></a>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/redbull">Red Bull</a>
The fan page for Red Bull is by far one of the best on Facebook. By implementing a number of innovative ideas and engaging apps, Red Bull makes the best of its Facebook presence and thus stands out from business pages for other brands. A good example of this is its Twitter stream, which, instead of featuring just Red Bull's corporate feed, assembles tweets from sponsored sports athletes and allows fans to connect with them beyond Red Bull’s domain. Live Web TV that anyone can view right on Facebook and a variety of fun games also encourage users to interact with the brand. While the welcome page is not in the default menu bar, it’s quite informative and serves as a compact graphic map of the entire Facebook page. Red Bull is also a pioneer of using Facebook as a recruiting tool; adding a careers board to a profile with so many fans makes sense indeed. Bravo Red Bull!

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/redbull"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="78" title="redbull" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c4c84a7d-87f4-4c07-91b3-1db8fe90adc5/redbull.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="445" /></a>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/skittles">Skittles</a>
Although Skittles’ fan page features two brightly designed, eye-catching tabs (one a graphic presentation with links, the other promoting its "Mob The Rainbow" campaign), the company has set its Wall tab as the default. This is typical of popular brands that don’t require an introduction. It allows fans and visitors to the page to immediately follow the company’s updates and join the conversation.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/skittles"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="79" title="skittles" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/fdfd51f3-b9a4-4575-b312-4fbfe6aefe97/skittles.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="413" /></a>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/cocacola">Coca-Cola</a>
Another giant with a million-plus Facebook fans, Coca-Cola has a fan-centric Facebook page. It encourages active user participation and interaction between the brand and its fans. The landing tab is set to the Coca-Cola introduction, which contains a dynamic box with latest updates and a “Like” button, links to other social network profiles for the brand, a fan highlights strip, and info about the product and the page's creators (by the way, this Facebook page was created by two Coke fans and then later supported officially by the company). Another highlight of the Coke fan page is photo albums: in addition to some standard product shots and event photographs, many other albums are included, presenting Coca-Cola not only as a popular beverage but as a multi-generational icon. Here is a good example of how to make use of photos on Facebook.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/cocacola"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="80" title="cocacola" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f5df4a39-e483-4fae-9bdf-c660cbeecaab/cocacola.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="436" /></a>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/twilight">Twilight Saga</a>
The default tab for the official fan page of the blockbuster series Twilight Saga is a large graphical tab promoting the latest episode, Eclipse. The custom tab incorporates elements of the movie's website and the trailer, live Twitter updates, links to official websites and other info. Two other custom tabs are dedicated to the second film, New Moon, and the official movie soundtrack. The entire page is rich in content and delivers its information effectively.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/twilight"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="81" title="twilight" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/99b5c891-f4f2-4094-a75a-f235abce0381/twilight.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="450" /></a>

### More Beautiful and Engaging Facebook Pages

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Room214">Room 214</a>
A nice approach to the Facebook welcome page is demonstrated by social media agency Room 214, based in Boulder, Colorado. The default tab, with its nice duo-tone and sketchy font, looks minimalist and attractive, and it focuses on introducing its team members. The "About" tab has a clean two-column layout, with some basic info about the company in the left column and cute roll-over links to the staff’s Twitter accounts, official website, blog, contact page and corporate Twitter page. Another graphic tab covers the agency’s clients. A simple yet well-executed fan page design.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Room214"><img title="room214" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7f3f8d18-0980-4902-9354-8620e887cdc8/room214.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="472" /></a>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/porsche">Porsche</a>
The ColorStyler tab on the fan page for Porsche is so darn great that one immediately wonders why on Earth they didn’t make it the default tab? The pure FBJS tab allows users to select a Porsche model and customize its look in a live preview mode, with a nifty color and rims picker. One then can send the Porsche image to a friend or publish it on the page's wall. This hidden gem makes the entire page shine.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/porsche"><img title="porsche" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/50194c85-47ca-47f0-97e9-4146d5d52ba0/porsche.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="439" /></a>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/digitalturf">Digital Turf</a>
The fan page for Digital Turf is an interesting and rather confusing case. The page design itself is wonderful: the excellent company presentation, two-level sub-navigation, diverse data and cute style is a feat of FBJS and makes this one of the most attractive business pages you'll see on Facebook. Here's the confusing part: Digital Turf specializes in developing Web-building and media solutions for political campaigns and organizations (maybe not exclusively, but that does figure prominently in its list of services). The question is whether this design style communicates the company’s strengths well enough to attract its target audience. If it solved this concern, Digital Turf could turn its fan page, which is awesome as it is, into a Facebook promo bomb.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/digitalturf"><img title="digitalturf" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/6dca421e-30be-492a-b584-aa6fd6d64f3a/digitalturf.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="464" /></a>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/RevisionEyewear">Revision Eyewear</a>
The main tab of the Revision Eyewear fan page features an impressive Flash intro, with bold photographs and transitions and a dynamic “Become a Fan” link. The eye-wear manufacturer also uses Facebook for its charity work; a custom graphic tab on the page explains its causes and displays donation links (the "Become a Fan" button turns into a donation button—very clever).

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/RevisionEyewear"><img title="revision-eyewear" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/edb85a5a-902a-46c7-91e3-09d8c5a0c8e5/revision-eyewear.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="462" /></a>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/ThurstonandBetts">Thurston &amp; Betts PLLC</a>
The Facebook page for law firm Thurston &amp; Betts is notable for its “Like Us!” tab. A simple informational scheme in the center, with nice roll-over buttons leading to the company’s website, is a clever solution: neat yet substantial. The tab also includes the firm's main contact info and a map of its location. It’s difficult to imagine a better Facebook page design for a law consultancy.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/ThurstonandBetts"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="82" title="Thurston-and-Betts" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/5fc5ac6b-5cda-4230-a2a4-54e5e63f2be3/thurston-and-betts.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="383" /></a>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/wordpressdesign">Daddy Design</a>
The fan page of Miami-based Web design studio Daddy Design includes two custom tabs: "About" and "Portfolio." Both tabs use the page's entire width, which, along with the striking orange color scheme, makes this page hard to pass by. The business page is tied closely to the company’s official website design, and it highlights a neat FBJS portfolio, with links to Daddy Design’s social profiles. It actually creates the feeling of a website within the Facebook page. Great work.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/wordpressdesign"><img title="daddy-design" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/869841cf-1592-4e5f-9275-1e6e10d54716/daddy-design.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="426" /></a>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/1800flowers">1-800-Flowers</a>
In our opinion, this is one of the best uses of a Facebook business page for e-commerce. By becoming a fan of 1-800-Flowers on Facebook, you can access up-to-date content, send virtual gifts to friends and shop for flowers right on Facebook (via the Flash-based application Alvenda). The company’s "Welcome" page has a simple and attractive grid, consisting of four sections that engage visitors with various activities. Also, the cool promo code field offers a discount to anyone who hits the "Like" button.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/1800flowers"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="83" title="1800flowers" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/b23c353d-99ff-40e8-af32-cb50e8470125/1800flowers.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="418" /></a>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/thegameteama">The Game – Team A</a>
The Game, for the Sony PS3, has two beautiful fan pages on Facebook, dedicated to each of the two teams in the game. The two pages have a similar design, featuring beautiful graphical tabs (and especially fine typefaces) that link to the interactive Facebook applications. The "About" tab includes an interactive worldwide game stats map, which is a nice touch.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/thegameteama"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="85" title="thegame" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2cdbe5f0-14f6-48cf-87bb-44fbd327e8b6/thegame.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="405" /></a>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/OxeloOfficiel">Oxelo</a>
Oxelo’s fan page would be rather generic if not for the inventive Diabolo Roller tab, which promotes its new model of roller blades. Built with a Flash app, it allows a nifty 360-degree view of the product.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/OxeloOfficiel"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="86" title="diabolo" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/6efc2292-9651-45c2-b708-a5e86c93e8b6/diabolo.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="390" /></a>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/teeseytees">Teesey Tees</a>
Teesey Tees use its Facebook presence effectively: it partially implements an e-commerce element from its website that allows Facebook users to browse t-shirt designs in a sleek FBJS gallery, directing them to the regular store for purchases. The fan page also includes a blog and a charming fan-only tab containing a discount code. There is no "About" or "Welcome" tab, and the default tab is set not to the product gallery (which one would expect) but to the Wall. While this is normal for big brands, it's not so clear why a company with a smaller audience, such as Teesey Tees, would do this. Still, this is an attractive and well-executed fan page.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/teeseytees"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="88" title="teeseytees" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/04d16335-f8c9-43cb-9960-ae5f92239de5/teeseytees.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="449" /></a>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/threadless">Threadless</a>
Popular t-shirt producer Threadless takes the e-commerce on its Facebook fan page to the next level. Here, the native Facebook tee design gallery is supplemented by a size-selection menu and shopping cart buttons, which direct the user to the cart on Threadless' website. The customer review section, with its "Share" and "Like" buttons, enhance the shopping experience of this fan page. Threadless also makes good use of the video and photos tabs, which, along with the live webcast section and active discussion board, make for an engaging, community-oriented Facebook presence.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/threadless"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="90" title="threadless" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ae8b2bac-98c6-48c0-9a97-646914937bbc/threadless.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="385" /></a>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Cranium">Cranium</a>
Board game Cranium has a beautiful Facebook fan page, which includes several promotional FBML pages. It doesn’t have any JavaScript gimmicks, just cutely drawn illustrations and cheerful colors that make for a positive visual experience.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Cranium"><img title="cranium" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2305036f-c9d6-4086-a9e1-f8beee8003f6/cranium.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="533" /></a>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/markmeyerphotography">Mark Meyer Photography</a>
Mark Meyer’s business page is a good example of how to promote one's personal brand effectively on Facebook. Using FBML and FMJS, the Alaska-based photographer outfits his custom tab with sub-tabs for his blog and photo gallery and an exquisite image slideshow. Status updates are also cleverly done, so that the Wall (the default tab) takes on the appearance of a photoblog.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/markmeyerphotography"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="91" title="markmeyer" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/1349da45-1251-430f-9f01-869e455b8417/markmeyer.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="415" /></a>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/livescribe">Livescribe</a>
The "Buy Now" tab on the Livescribe Smartpen fan page has an Amazon-ish design: it’s rich in content and options, but may require the touch of someone like Jacob Nielsen to be truly usable. Livescribe effectively uses multimedia on its Facebook page, which certainly presents its product favorably and is good for fan interaction on the page. But we would suggest that the company rearrange the position of its tabs, putting some interesting sections (such as the Pencasts, which are animated Flash videos of handwritten notes and audio captured by the Smartpen) in the main bar, instead of, say, the standard "Boxes" tab.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/livescribe"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="92" title="livescribe" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/50e3721b-998a-4616-b28a-9273ca577924/livescribe.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="520" /></a>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/BODUMUSA">Bodum USA</a>
The highlight of Bodum's Facebook business page is its excellent use of an iFrame to embed the company’s online store and interactive catalogue, which is powered by iPaper, onto the Facebook profile. In other words, Facebook users can shop for Bodum products without leaving the page.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/BODUMUSA"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="93" title="bodum" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/449fd20d-a0e1-4d2f-92f7-f0ebf49a6524/bodum.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="382" /></a>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/SoulCityChurch">Soul City Church</a>
The "Welcome" tab of the Soul City Church Facebook page is by far the smoothest pearl in our collection of fan page designs. The clean layout, the neat typography and icons and, of course, the awesome combination of black-and-white photography and energetic green elements result in a stunning intro page. It portrays the church as a progressive and contemporary community. Credit for the great job goes to <a href="https://monstereyes.com/">Monster Eyes</a>.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/SoulCityChurch"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="95" title="soulcitychurch" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ca3a08d9-9191-4926-bbd3-428de3bf543d/soulcitychurch.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="375" /></a>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Diesel">Diesel</a>
Famous apparel brand Diesel has three out-of-the-mold tabs, the most noteworthy of which is the one labelled "Sex Sells." It is built on a Flash app and provides a stylish and original showcase for the denim collection of the same name.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Diesel"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="97" title="diesel" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/1df020af-aa08-4daf-adfe-dae57e96141f/diesel.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="383" /></a>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/LancomeGermany">Lancome Germany</a>
This one will appeal to those who admire good typography. The "About" section of Lancome Germany's Facebook page takes on a website-within-a-tab format. It features elegant and polished typography, accompanied by high-quality photography.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/LancomeGermany"><img title="lancome" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/5caed39b-2e6f-444b-aa2f-e3e02164e82f/lancome.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="411" /></a>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/EcoArtwaredotcom">Eco-Artware.com</a>
The Facebook business page for Eco-Artware.com features a nice FBJS "Shop" tab. It’s a pseudo-shop, though; in fact, it’s just a featured product gallery, in which both product thumbnails and catalogue categories are linked to the official online store. Nevertheless, the clean grid layout and nice roll-overs for the product images make this a beautiful and useful fan page tab. Eco-Artware.com also makes good use of the "Boxes" tab by setting it as the default.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/EcoArtwaredotcom"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="101" title="ecoartware" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/df9bc215-cd73-43d1-9e2a-433f92a24d79/ecoartware.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="375" /></a>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/official311">311</a>
The official Facebook page of music band 311, particularly the "News &amp; Multimedia" tab, is eye candy. Designed in a cool retro poster style, it contains basic info about the band and a built-in multimedia player. A large "Fan Photos" section reflects the band’s commitment to communicating with its fans. Well done!

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/official311"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="102" title="311" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a845ef5e-42e5-4d9c-a2f0-c7de7c05b352/311.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="408" /></a>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/REI">Rei</a>
Outdoor gear and clothing provider REI uses its Facebook profile to foster strong interactivity, rather than merely to present a plain front. Its fan page is basically a community portal where the company engages people with its social campaigns and projects. The fan page includes two Flash tabs that feature community pictures, links and fun family games.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/REI"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="104" title="rei" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e4b3cdc1-a09e-417b-88cc-1660b51a5f20/rei.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="385" /></a>

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Desigual">Desigual</a>
The fan page for Spanish apparel brand Desigual is bursting with color, freshness and style. It is versatile, with various types of promotional and entertaining content, yet not overwhelming. The mood is set equally by great content and classy design elements. Desigual points out that the page was started by fans and then made official by the brand; this is clearly illustrated on the Wall feed, where user-created updates are set to default along with the company’s messages.

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Desigual"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="105" title="desigual" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/954125be-aad9-44c6-89a7-eedca9eac648/desigual.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="399" /></a>
