## Getting Started

Getting started is easy. Just choose the subscription of your choice, proceed with the checkout and find your eBooks in your personal dashboard: that's also where you can suggest and vote on the upcoming eBook titles as well as topics in the Smashing Magazine. New eBooks will be available for download automatically at the end of every month. You will be notified about new eBooks via email, of course.

We're working hard on the new topics and are proud to be able to start you off with the recently released [Photoshop/Illustrator/Fireworks Bundle](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/ebooks/#graphics_ebooks)—that's three brand-new Smashing eBooks to get started with.</p>

## Why Subscription Model?

When we launched this little website over six years ago, we wanted it to serve one specific purpose: to deliver valuable, reliable, practical insights to people who were building websites just like we were. Time has passed, and many things have changed, yet our deep commitment to this initial idea has never been stronger.

It's with this commitment that we are proud to announce our new undertaking, a little extra that will help us make your reading experience on Smashing Magazine better, cleaner and more valuable in every way. Meet [The Smashing eBook Library](https://www.smashinglibrary.com/), an annual eBook subscription for our very own Smashing eBooks.

Smashing Magazine is and has always been **free and independent**, a publication deeply committed to quality work and professionalism in the best interests of the Web design community. We are proud of our thorough editorial work, based on principles that are postulated in our [Publishing Policy](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/publishing-policy/). We don't take the efforts of our contributors for granted. Every contribution deserves credit and respect, care and attention, acknowledgement and honorarium—which is why everybody involved in the editorial process always gets paid for their work, whether they want it or not.

Of course quality work doesn't come at a cheap price. You know it, and so do we: Smashing Magazine strongly relies on the page impressions that its articles generate. At times, this reliance can collide with the editorial principles and guidelines that every Smashing Magazine article has to follow.</p>

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d9c98a7e-6de6-457d-8998-7f6ce52a2ff2/policy03.png" width="240" alt="We have a thorough quality control system in place and we make sure that the article respects the rights of authors, designers, photographers and developers." /> <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/69b3a308-6603-4b14-99eb-99f0ddbc5ab3/policy01.png" width="240" alt="No hidden advertisements" /><figcaption>Smashing Magazine's thorough <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/publishing-policy/">Publishing Policy</a> clearly states the rules and guidelines of our editorial work. We never publish sponsored articles or paid content; all ads are always clearly marked as such.</figcaption></figure>

**We want Smashing Magazine to be all about you**. We want to provide a better and cleaner reading experience on the website and we want to invest more in new formats and sections—practical guides, case studies, tests and benchmarks, new regular columns and Q&A, expert advice for newcomers and many others. We want to further improve and enrich the content in the magazine and deliver more valuable content available for free for everybody to use and learn from. And this is where we could use your help.

We never accept donations or gifts, but we produce printed books and eBooks that help us stabilize the financial viability of the website while delivering value to our customers at the same time. By offering you a valuable product, we hope to provide a tangible value for the money you pay when purchasing our products. And before you ask: yes, **Smashing Magazine will always remain free**. And with your help we want to make our little publication as _smashing_ as we know it can be. How? Well, with the [Smashing eBook Library](https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/checkout/cart/) of course.

The best content, for the best price—just waiting for you to be downloaded onto your iPad, Kindle or any other eBook reader.

#### You support Smashing Magazine.

The high quality of the content on Smashing Magazine is held at the heart of what we do every single day. We'd love it to be only about the content for you, dear reader, not about the page impressions that articles generate.

### FAQ & Support

Of course, you don't need an eBook reader to read the eBooks—you can read the PDF version on your computer, but the EPUB and Amazon Kindle formats for your eBook readers or tablets are available as well. We'll renew your subscription automatically at the end of the year so you won't miss any eBooks, but if you decide not to continue, just cancel the subscription at least four weeks before the end of your subscription.

Don't worry: you'll still have access to your eBooks after your subscription has expired! You can always change your preferences in the dashboard. You can find more details in the [Subscription Terms and Conditions](https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/tac.html/) as well as in our [Smashing Library FAQ](https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/faq/).
