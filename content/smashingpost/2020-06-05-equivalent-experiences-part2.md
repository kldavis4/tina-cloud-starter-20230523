This is the second of two articles on the topic of how digital accessibility is informed by equivalency. [Previously](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/05/equivalent-experiences-part1/), we have learned about the underlying biases that inform digital product creation, what isn‚Äôt an equivalent experience, the compounding effects of inaccessible design and code, and powerful motivating forces for doing better.

In this article, I will discuss learning how to embrace an equivalent, inclusive mindset. I will also provide practical, robust ways to improve your websites and web apps by providing solutions to common, everyday barriers cited by the people I interviewed.

## Setting A Standard

[The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) outlines in painstaking detail how to craft accessible digital experiences. While a long and dense document, it is incredibly comprehensive &mdash; to the point where it‚Äôs been [codified as an international standard](https://www.iso.org/standard/58625.html). For over 10 years, we‚Äôve had a globally agreed upon, canonical definition of what constitutes as usable.

### How Would I?

If you need a little help constructing the initial mental framework the WCAG gets at, a question I always ask myself when making something is, ‚ÄúHow would I use this if‚Ä¶‚Äù It‚Äôs a question that gets you to check [all the biases](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) that might be affecting you in the moment.

Examples could be:

<ul>
	<li>How would I use this if...</li>
	<ul>
		<li>...I can‚Äôt see the screen?</li>
		<li>...I can‚Äôt move my arms?</li>
		<li>...I‚Äôm sensitive to flashing and strobing animation?</li>
		<li>...English isn‚Äôt my primary language?</li>
		<li>...I have a limited budget for bandwidth?</li>
		<li>...I‚Äôve set a large default type size?</li>
		<li>...and so on.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

### A Gentle Introduction

If you‚Äôre looking for a more approachable resource for how to dig into what the WCAG covers, the [Inclusive Design Principles](https://inclusivedesignprinciples.org/) would be a great place to start. The seven principles it describes all map back to [WCAG success criterion](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#levels).

## Learn From The People Who Actually Use It

You don‚Äôt have to take my word for it. Here are some common issues cited by the people I interviewed, and how to fix them:

### Wayfinding

#### Headings

Heading elements are incredibly important for maintaining an equivalent, accessible experience.

When [constructed with skill and care](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/the-importance-of-heading-levels-for-assistive-technology--cms-31753), heading elements allow screen reader users to quickly determine the contents of a page or view and navigate to content relevant to their interests. This is equivalent to [how someone might quickly flit around](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-people-read-online/), scrolling until something that looks pertinent comes into view.

{{< rimg href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/b5b4856e-480c-4d79-8b0e-b80db474c4df/equivalent-experiences-headings.png" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/b5b4856e-480c-4d79-8b0e-b80db474c4df/equivalent-experiences-headings.png" sizes="100vw" caption="The <a href='https://www.learningapps.co.uk/moodle/xertetoolkits/play.php?template_id=1309#page1'>HeadingsMap browser extension</a> lets you view a page‚Äôs heading hierarchy. (<a href='https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/b5b4856e-480c-4d79-8b0e-b80db474c4df/equivalent-experiences-headings.png'>Large preview</a>)" alt="A graphic showing how nested heading elements correspond to the layout of a design for a site called SkyList. The first level heading is ‚ÄúTypes of Clouds,‚Äù which maps to the page‚Äôs h1 element. The three h2 heading elements read, ‚ÄúHigh,‚Äù ‚ÄúMid-level,‚Äù and ‚ÄúLow.‚Äù Each of these headings is represented in the design as a shaded area. Within each area are card designs, including an image placeholder, a title, and a paragraph placeholder. The h3 heading elements for the High section cards are ‚ÄúCirrus,‚Äù ‚ÄúCirrostratus,‚Äù and ‚ÄúCirrocumulus.‚Äù The h3 heading elements for the Mid-level section cards are ‚ÄúAltocumulus,‚Äù ‚ÄúAltostratus,‚Äù and ‚ÄúNimbostratus.‚Äù The h3 heading elements for the Low section cards are ‚ÄúCumulus,‚Äù ‚ÄúStratus,‚Äù ‚ÄúCumulonimbus,‚Äù and ‚ÄúStratocumulus.‚Äù" >}}

[Justin Yarbrough](https://twitter.com/FatElvis04) voices poorly-authored heading elements as a concern, and he‚Äôs not alone.

[WebAIM‚Äôs screen reader survey](https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey8/#finding) cites headings as the most important way to find information. This survey is well-worth paying attention to, as it provides valuable insight into how disabled people actually use assistive technology.

#### Landmarks

In addition to heading elements, another way to determine the overall structure and layout are [landmarks](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2018/03/03/landmarks.html). Landmarks are roles implicitly described by [HTML sectioning elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#Content_sectioning), used to help describe the overall composition of the main page or view areas.

{{< rimg href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/9f207bf7-1ceb-48d5-9446-362508657077/equivalent-experiences-landmarks.png" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/9f207bf7-1ceb-48d5-9446-362508657077/equivalent-experiences-landmarks.png" sizes="100vw" caption="These are five of the eight landmark HTML elements and the roles using them create. (<a href='https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/9f207bf7-1ceb-48d5-9446-362508657077/equivalent-experiences-landmarks.png'>Large preview</a>)" alt="A ‚Äòholy grail‚Äô layout showing a header element row stretching across three columns. Below that is another row with three columns, using nav, main, and aside elements. Below that is a third and final column-stretching row  using the footer element. Each element is also labeled with its corresponding landmark." >}}

Here‚Äôs what Justin has to say:

<blockquote>‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm just trying to find the main content, I‚Äôll first try the <kbd>Q</kbd> JAWS shortcut key to see if a <code>main</code> region‚Äôs set up. If not, I‚Äôm just more or less stuck trying to scan the page to find it arrowing through the page.‚Äù</blockquote>

Much as how we might use a layer group name of ‚Äúprimary nav‚Äù in our design file, or a class name of `c-nav-primary` in our CSS, it‚Äôs important we also use a [`nav` sectioning element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav) to describe our main site navigation (as well as any other navigation the page or view contains).

Doing so ensures intent is carried all the way through from conception, to implementation, to use. The same notion carries through for [the other HTML sectioning elements that create landmarks](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/landmarks/HTML5.html) for assistive technology.

### Labeled Controls

[Brian Moore](https://twitter.com/bmoore123) tells us about ‚Äúform fields with no label or at least one that isn‚Äôt programmatically associated so it doesn‚Äôt read anything.‚Äù

It‚Äôs another [frustratingly common problem](https://webaim.org/projects/million/#labels).

Providing a valid `for`/`id` attribute pairing creates a programmatic association between [form inputs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#Forms) and [the label that describes what it does](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label). And when I say `label`, I mean the `label` element. Not a clickable `div`, a [placeholder](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/06/placeholder-attribute/), `aria-label`, or some other [brittle and/or overwrought solution](https://www.matsuko.ca/blog/stop-using-material-design-text-fields/). `label` elements are a tried-and-true solution that enjoys [wide and deep support](https://a11ysupport.io/tech/html/label_element) for accessibility.

In addition, a `label` element should not be used by itself, say for a label on a diagram. This might seem counter-intuitive at first, but please bear with me.

<div class="break-out">

 <pre><code class="language-css">&lt;!-- Please do this --&gt;
&lt;label for="your-name"&gt;Your name&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input type="text" id="your-name" name="your-name" autocomplete="name"&gt;

&lt;!-- Don‚Äôt do this --&gt;
&lt;label for="eye"&gt;Cornea&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;label for="eye"&gt;Pupil&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;label for="eye"&gt;Lens&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;label for="eye"&gt;Retina&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;label for="eye"&gt;Optic Nerve&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;img id="eye" alt="A diagram of the human eye." src="parts-of-the-eye.png" /&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

The same kinds of assistive technology that let a person jump to headings and landmarks also allow them to jump to input labels. Because of this, there is the expectation that when a `label` element is present, there is also a corresponding input it is associated with.

### Alternative Descriptions

If you have low or no vision, and/or have difficulty understanding an image, [HTML‚Äôs alt attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#attr-alt) (and not [the title attribute](https://developer.paciellogroup.com/blog/2013/01/using-the-html-title-attribute-updated/)) provides a mechanism to understand what the image is there for. The same principle applies for providing captions for video and audio content like [podcasts](https://thisten.co/).

[Kenny Hitt](https://twitter.com/hittsjunk) mentions that when:

<blockquote>‚Äú‚Ä¶someone posts something on Twitter, if it‚Äôs just an unlabeled image, I don‚Äôt even take the time to participate in the conversation. When you start every conversation by asking what‚Äôs in the picture, it really derails things.‚Äù</blockquote>

[Up until last week](https://twitter.com/TwitterA11y/status/1265689579371323392), the only way for Twitter to [provide alternative descriptions for its images](https://adrianroselli.com/2016/03/twitter-has-alt-text-with-some-caveats.html) was to enable an option buried away in the subsection of a preference menu. Compare this to a platform like [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/), where the feature is enabled by default.

<figure class="video-container break-out"><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EXYPYXZq7uI" width="600" height="480" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>

[Soren Hamby](https://linktr.ee/uxicorn), mentions [Stitcher](https://www.stitcher.com/), a popular podcast app. ‚ÄúThe onboarding was a lot of themed graphics, but the alt text for each one was ‚Äòunselected‚Äô and for the same image with a check over it was selected. I think it would be reasonable for them to say ‚Äòsci-fi genre selected‚Äô [‚Ä¶] it‚Äôs such a small thing but it makes all the difference.‚Äù

Ensuring that alternate description content is concise and descriptive is just as important as including the ability to add it. [Daniel G√∂ransson](https://twitter.com/danielgoransson), a developer for [Axess Lab](https://axesslab.com/), has a [great article on how to write them effectively](https://axesslab.com/alt-texts/).

Robust, accessible features can also be part of evaluation criteria, as well as a great method for building customer loyalty. Soren mentions that they are ‚Äúoften the deciding factor, especially between services.‚Äù In particular, they cite Netflix‚Äôs audio descriptions.

### ARIA

One topic Daniel G√∂ransson‚Äôs article on alternative descriptions mentions is to not over-describe things. This includes information like that it is an image, who the photographer is, and keyword stuffing.

The same principle applies for [Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/). ARIA is a set of attributes designed to extend HTML to fill in the gaps between interactive content and assistive technology. When ARIA is used to completely replace HTML, it oftentimes leads to an over-described experience.

Brian explains: ‚ÄúThere seems to be a perception that more ARIA fixes accessibility and it can help, but too much either reads wrong things or just talks way too much. If on screen text of one or two words is good enough for everyone else, it is good enough for screen reader users too. We don‚Äôt need whole sentence or two descriptions of buttons or links i.e ‚Äòlink privacy policy‚Äô is far better than something like ‚Äòthis link will open our privacy policy, this link will open in a new window‚Äô when the on screen link text is ‚Äòprivacy policy.‚Äô‚Äù

[The First Rule of ARIA Use](https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/#rule1) advises us to only use it when a native element won‚Äôt suffice. [You don‚Äôt need to describe what your interactive component is](https://adrianroselli.com/2019/10/stop-giving-control-hints-to-screen-readers.html) or how it works, the same way you don‚Äôt need to include the word ‚Äúimage‚Äù in your alternative description.

Provided that you use the appropriate native HTML element, assistive technology will handle all of that for you. Do more, more robustly, with less effort? Sounds great to me!

{{< rimg href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/dcbac946-6e41-4cb5-b10f-f7bc7b9ee2bf/equivalent-experiences-code-to-at-diagram.png" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/dcbac946-6e41-4cb5-b10f-f7bc7b9ee2bf/equivalent-experiences-code-to-at-diagram.png" sizes="100vw" caption="(<a href='https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/dcbac946-6e41-4cb5-b10f-f7bc7b9ee2bf/equivalent-experiences-code-to-at-diagram.png'>Large preview</a>)" alt="A code sample of an anchor element wrapping an image, with an alt description that reads, ‚ÄúA cat wearing a party hat.‚Äù Arrows from the HTML elements and attributes point towards how everything combines to create a phrase spoken aloud by a screen reader. The phrase reads, ‚ÄúLink. Image. A cat wearing a party hat." >}}

Unlike most of HTML, CSS, and JS, the success of implemented ARIA is contextual, variable, and largely invisible. In spite of this, we seem to be [slathering ARIA onto everything](https://css-tricks.com/aria-spackle-not-rebar/) without bothering to check not only if it actually works, but also [what the people who actually use it think of it](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-07-11-user-testing-accessible-client-routing/).

[Support for ARIA](https://a11ysupport.io/) is fragmented across operating systems, browsers, and assistive technology offerings, all their respective versions, and every possible permutation of all three. Simply put, writing ARIA and trusting it will work as intended isn‚Äôt enough.

If misconfigured and/or over-applied, [ARIA can break](https://a11yproject.com/posts/aria-has-perfect-support/). It may not report actual functionality, announce the wrong functionality, and (accurately or inaccurately) over-describe functionality. Obviously, these experiences aren‚Äôt equivalent.

[Representation matters](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_About_Us_Without_Us). To get a better understanding of how the ARIA code you wrote actually works, I recommend hiring people to tell you. Here are four such services that do exactly that:

- [Accessible360](https://accessible360.com/)
- [AccessWorks (by Knowbility)](https://access-works.com/)
- [Fable Tech Labs](https://www.makeitfable.com/)
- [Perkins School For The Blind](https://www.perkins.org/services/other)

### Contrast

#### Color Contrast

Color contrast is another common issue, one whose severity often seems to be downplayed. If I could wager a guess, it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs easy to forget that other people‚Äôs vision might be different than your own. Regardless, it is a concern that affects [a wide swath of the global population](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/blindness-and-visual-impairment), and we should treat the issue with the seriousness it deserves.

The Click-Away Pound Survey tells us that out of the top issues faced by users with access needs, contrast and legibility weighs in as the fifth most significant issue. On top of that, it has *increased* as a concern, going from 44% of respondents in 2016 to 55% in 2019.

We live in an age where there‚Äôs more color contrast checking resources than I can count. Products like [Stark](https://www.getstark.co/) can help designers audit their designs before it is translated into code. Tools like [Eightshape‚Äôs Contrast Grid](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/) and [Atul Varma‚Äôs Accessible color palette builder](https://toolness.github.io/accessible-color-matrix/) let you craft your design systems with robust, accessible color combinations out of the gate.

{{< rimg href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d0c224c0-8588-491d-b641-bffb0cfe1928/equivalent-experiences-side-by-side-comparison.png" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d0c224c0-8588-491d-b641-bffb0cfe1928/equivalent-experiences-side-by-side-comparison.png" sizes="100vw" caption="(<a href='https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d0c224c0-8588-491d-b641-bffb0cfe1928/equivalent-experiences-side-by-side-comparison.png'>Large preview</a>)" alt="A side-by-side comparison demonstrating acceptable and bad color contrast ratios. The first example shows black text on a dark yellow background, with a passing contrast ratio of 9.89:1. The second example shows light gray text on a light blue background, with a failing contrast ratio of 2.13:1. The text for both examples reads, ‚ÄúThe lighting collection ranges from timeless classics to contemporary designs that make for perfect additions to any home and space.‚Äù" >}}

The somewhat ironic thing about color contrast is how, ah, visible it is. While some of the previous accessibility issues are invisible‚Äîhidden away as the underlying code‚Äîcontrast is a pretty straightforward issue.

Mostly, contrast is a binary scenario, in that you either can or cannot see content. So, the next time you check your website or webapp with an automated accessibility checker such as [Deque‚Äôs axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/), don‚Äôt be so quick to downplay the color contrast errors it reports.

#### High Contrast

There are technology solutions for situations where even satisfactory color contrast ratios isn‚Äôt sufficient‚Äînamely, [inverted colors mode](https://a11yproject.com/posts/operating-system-and-browser-accessibility-display-modes/#inverted-colors-mode) and [High Contrast Mode](https://a11yproject.com/posts/operating-system-and-browser-accessibility-display-modes/#high-contrast-mode). Many participants I interviewed mentioned using these display modes during their daily computer use.

Provided you use semantic HTML, both of these modes [don‚Äôt need much effort on the development end of things](https://www.gwhitworth.com/blog/2017/04/how-to-use-ms-high-contrast/) to work well. The important bit is to check out what you‚Äôre building in these two modes to make sure everything is working as intended.

## Striving For Perfection

To quote [L√©onie Watson](https://tink.uk/),

<blockquote>‚ÄúAccessibility doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect, it just needs to be a little bit better than yesterday.‚Äù</blockquote>

By understanding both why, and how to improve your digital accessibility experiences in ways that directly address common barriers, you‚Äôre able to provide meaningful and enjoyable experiences to all.
