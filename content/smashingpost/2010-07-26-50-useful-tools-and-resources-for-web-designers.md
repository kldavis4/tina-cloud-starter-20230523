  An effective, well-organized workflow is an important asset of professional
  web designers. The more useful and time-saving your tools are, the more time
  you can focus on important things, thus creating a foundation for timely
  good-quality results. The problem is that there are just way too many tools,
  services and resources out there, so it has become difficult to keep track on
  them and find those tiny little time-savers that will spare you headaches and

An effective, well-organized workflow is an important asset of professional web designers. The more useful and time-saving your tools are, the more time you can focus on important things, thus creating a foundation for timely good-quality results. The problem is that there are just way too many tools, services and resources out there, so it has become difficult to keep track on them and find those tiny little time-savers that will spare you headaches and save time in a long run.

And this is where we come in. Back in old days, Smashing Magazine used to publish lists after lists, with plethora of links that covered different topics all somehow related to web design and development. We have undergone quite a development since then, and are now publishing almost only in-depth articles — written by some of the best professionals in the industry. However, useful, carefully prepared and filtered lists are still useful, and therefore we keep publishing them as well.

Below you'll find **50 useful tools and time-savers for web designers and developers**. Among other things, you will find recently released tools, useful reference sheets, articles and further resources. Such posts are prepared over months, each containing resources found, reviewed or bookmarked by the Smashing Editorial Team. We hope that at least some of them will help you improve your workflow!

## Typography

 [Meet Your Type: A Field Guide to Typography (free PDF)](https://www.fontshop.com/education/)  
This eBook will help you better understand the foundation of typography and overcome common obstacles and problems when choosing type.

[![Education](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/bb8692ad-bd94-411d-8608-239eaea59af1/useful-tool-122.jpg)](https://www.fontshop.com/education/)

<a href="https://webfontspecimen.com/">Web Font Specimen</a>
This template lets you check the typography by analyzing the HTML-specimen in your browser. The specimen contains whole paragraphs in various line heights and font sizes, different headings, ordered and unordered lists, as well as italic and bold text. You can analyze the body size comparison that reveals aspects of the typeface that can't otherwise be seen and study single glyphs, measure, grayscale as well as light on dark and dark on light previews. You may want to check out <a href="https://www.goodwebfonts.com/">Good Web Fonts</a> for the actual specimens of various legible screen fonts.

[Web FontFont User Guide (PDF)](https://www.fontshop.com/blog/newsletters/pdf/webfontfontuserguide.pdf)  
This Web FontFont User Guide contains information about typography aimed at different groups of people: web developers, system administrators and website visitors. You may want to consider giving it to your clients or colleagues.

[![Web FontFont User Guide](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/da8ecb9c-0c78-411c-9866-36d67c37a225/useful-126.jpg)](https://www.fontshop.com/blog/newsletters/pdf/webfontfontuserguide.pdf)

<a href="https://code.google.com/p/altfontprev/">AltFontPrev</a>
This is a simple JavaScript bookmarklet that lets you view the font stack of any website and then deactivate each font with a single click. It makes it easy not only to make sure everything looks okay when certain fonts aren't installed on a user's system, but also to view the fonts included in the website's font stack in a single click, rather than opening the source code. You can even specify a custom font, which makes it handy when you're considering changing a design's current font.

![Screenshot](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/74569fe7-33a1-411d-b8fd-882fada0821c/altfontprev.jpg)

Typografix
This tool is an HTML re-processing script for creating beautiful typography. It corrects things like ellipses and smart quotes and adds tags for <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> automatically. The en dash, for example, is created automatically when a hyphen is surrounded by spaces, and the em dash is created when two dashes appear in a row. Typografix is written in C#, requires Windows Installer 3.1 and .NET Framework 3.5 SP1.

<a href="https://inamidst.com/stuff/unidata/">Unicode Codepoint Chart</a>
This chart is broken down neatly by type of character and symbol (and by language in many cases), with a visual reference under each category. From there, just click on the symbol or character you want and you're brought to a page with detailed information about the character, along with a browser test page, an outline (in SVG format) and a variety of encodings and character sets (HTML entity, UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32, ISO-8859-8, etc.).</p>

## Bookmarklets

<a href="https://quixapp.com/">Quix</a>
We have covered Quix several once already, but when one talks about bookmarklets, it is just necessary to mention Quix as well. Wouldn't it be nice to have a powerful command line in your browser, some kind of shell that lets you use handy commands and shortcuts for a quicker and more productive workflow? That's exactly what Quix offers. The tool is a clever extensible bookmarklet that lets you both access your bookmarks and perform various operations on other websites.

<a href="https://iamnotagoodartist.com/other/wordpress-admin-toolbar-bookmarklet/">WP-Toolbar bookmarklet</a>
This tool will save a lot of clicks as you edit or update posts on your WordPress-powered blog. The bookmarklet gives you quick access to the entire administrative back-end directly in your browser's window. There is also a <span class="removed_link" title="https://www.kulturbolschewismus.de/2010/03/03/wordpress-admin-toolbar/">GreaseMonkey script</span> that automatically loads the toolbar when you visit a particular website.

[![Screenshot](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e11efce5-8c4d-4f62-8bf4-88a71bcde317/wp-toolbar.jpg)](https://iamnotagoodartist.com/other/wordpress-admin-toolbar-bookmarklet/)

   [Print Friendly Bookmarklet](https://www.printfriendly.com/)  
This bookmarklet strips advertising, navigation and all things that you don't want to have when you decide to print out a page. It formats the content of an article or a document for great readbility and generates a minimal and clean PDF for printing.

[![Print Friendly and PDF](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e6d7c7d7-1a5a-4c09-8a6d-13936a7d0e3a/useful-tool-125.jpg)](https://www.printfriendly.com/)

<a href="https://w-shadow.com/bookmarklet-combiner/">Bookmarklet Combiner</a>
This tool creates a master bookmarklet which can either run all bookmarks at once or display a menu at some area of the page. Nice service for users who wants to avoid using a special folder only to hold all bookmarklets.

<a href="https://css-tricks.com/examples/ThePrintliminator/">The Printliminator</a>
The Printliminator is a bookmarklet with some simple tools you can use to makes websites print better. One click to activate, and then click to remove elements from the page, remove graphics, and apply better print styling.

 Bespin Bookmarklet  
Using the Bespin Bookmarklet, you can replace any textarea you encounter with a Bespin editor, making editing the text much more pleasant.

## CSS, HTML and JavaScript Tools

<a href="https://ecsstender.org/">eCSStender</a>
Extensions built with eCSStender simplify the design process because you can author modern CSS using advanced selectors, properties such as border-radius, or custom font faces and rest assured that your design will work &mdash; even in IE6.

[![eCSStender](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/43cecb2e-da4b-4c08-9efb-a838c3ae4472/useful-tool-1031.jpg)](https://ecsstender.org/)

CoffeeScript
This is a little programming language that compiles JavaScript while simplifying the code that developers actually have to deal with. It works with current JavaScript libraries and compiles clean code, leaving even comments intact. Once developers familiarize themselves with how CoffeeScript works, they could potentially save themselves a lot of time and headaches with the simplified code.

![Screenshot](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f120bedd-ac64-4156-974b-30f0d1edda50/coffeescript.jpg)

<a href="https://hashgrid.com/">#grid</a>
#grid is a little tool that inserts a grid onto the Web page. You can hold the grid in place and toggle it between the foreground and background. To display the grid, just press a hot key on your keyboard, and you can set your own short keys to switch views.

[![Screenshot](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/1f7a335e-3c53-4ced-b1ef-a756ed8bf966/analog.gif)](https://hashgrid.com/)

<a href="https://www.primercss.com/">Primer CSS</a>
This tiny generator works online and has only one function: it extracts from an HTML page (copying and pasting will do) a framework of classes and IDs that can be used as the foundation of an external style sheet. This can be wonderful if you work by first doing the structure in HTML, and then the forms and colors in the style sheet.

[![Screenshot](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/1aca7328-98c0-473d-aa9a-ca5d34dc3bab/handy-008.jpg)](https://www.primercss.com/)

<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/10704">CSS Usage</a>
CSS Coverage is an extension for Firebug which allows you to scan multiple pages of your site to see which CSS rules are actually used in your site. Each time you run a scan, the CSS files that are included in the current page are shown with the number of times the rules has been found applied on your page before it.

JS Bin is an application specifically designed to help JavaScript- and CSS-developers to test snippets of code, within some context, and debug the code collaboratively. JS Bin allows you to edit and test JavaScript and HTML  (reloading the URL also maintains the state of your code, new tabs doesn't). Once you're happy you can save, and send the URL to a peer for  review or help. They can then make further changes saving anew if  required.

[Design Is History](https://www.designishistory.com/)  
This resource showcases the evolution of design through time. It was created as a teaching tool for young designers just beginning to explore graphic design and as a reference tool for all designers. As a designer it is important to understand where design came from, how it developed, and who shaped its evolution. The more exposure you have to past, current and future design trends, styles and designers, the larger your problem-solving toolkit. The larger your toolkit, the more effective of a designer you can be.
