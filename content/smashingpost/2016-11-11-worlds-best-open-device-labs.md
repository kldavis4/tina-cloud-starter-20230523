  Every developer knows that just because a website looks like and does what
  it’s meant to on the latest iPhone, doesn’t mean it will work across every
  mobile device. In this article, we’ll **highlight some of the many open device
  labs** out there — fantastic and helpful initiatives by the community that
  deserve support and attention.

  Open device labs (ODLs) are a response to the myriad of operating systems,
  browsers and devices that litter our technical landscape. They offer
  developers a (usually) free space to go to test their web systems, websites
  and apps on a range of software and hardware. This premise forms the core of
  the [OpenDeviceLab.com](https://www.OpenDeviceLab.com) initiative, which is a
  community movement to help people locate the right ODL for the job and to drum
  up further support for these testing centers.

Every developer knows that just because a website looks like and does what it’s meant to on the latest iPhone, doesn’t mean it will work across every mobile device. In this article, we’ll <strong>highlight some of the many open device labs</strong> out there — fantastic and helpful initiatives by the community that deserve support and attention.</p>

Open device labs (ODLs) are a response to the myriad of operating systems, browsers and devices that litter our technical landscape. They offer developers a (usually) free space to go to test their web systems, websites and apps on a range of software and hardware. This premise forms the core of the <a href="https://www.OpenDeviceLab.com">OpenDeviceLab.com</a> initiative, which is a community movement to help people locate the right ODL for the job and to drum up further support for these testing centers.</p>

<a href="https://twitter.com/klick_ass">Andre Jay Meissner</a>, founder of <a href="https://lab-up.org/">LabUp!</a> and OpenDeviceLab.com, explains:
<blockquote>Testing on a variety of real devices is crucial for ensuring the intended user experience, especially looking over the boundaries of each ones own cultural and/or economic area. But, by far not everybody has access to the necessary test bed. Think of people producing content/apps for the first world, not taking less developed regions or those with a completely different mobile device landscape into account — the business will fail on one side, since UX or even plain accessibility will suck on the other.</blockquote>

He adds:
<blockquote>ODLs even provide ways to get stakeholders and customers to live the urge for necessary budget decisions on quality assurance, accessibility and I18n and L10n.</blockquote>

## Consolidating The ODL Landscape

There are now more than 150 ODLs in 35+ countries, but ODLs may have reached the peak of their popularity, given the growing attention on in-house device labs (IDLs).

While new ODLs are opening at a constant rate, a handful of ODLs have closed down due to a lack of demand. Penn State University, for example, recently closed its ODL and replaced it with a virtual-only offering, due to a lack of funding, despite being the only one in the region. This virtual testing environment now mainly uses BrowserStack and similar virtual machine (VM) platforms.

Greg O’Toole, a lecturer at Penn State University, says:
<blockquote>We have had fairly consistent interest and inquiry levels from groups and individual software developers from around the Penn State community and the PA community at large looking for ways to get involved and/or utilize the offerings of the ODL@PSU over the past 24 months. I am optimistic still. We have had several offers from these community members to donate Fitbit devices, old laptops, etc. which sort of orbit around the target set of devices we are looking for.</blockquote>

## ODLs Have Opened Doors For IDLs

IDLs do seem to be a popular option. Many of the labs we spoke with originated on a company’s property, eventually opening up as ODLs to support the development work of others.

Christian Schaefer, freelance front-end developer from the ODL initiative, says:
<blockquote>I don’t think ODLs are important in today’s technical landscape, IDLs are. ODLs served the purpose of steering the people’s interest towards the topic of real device testing. And ODLs may also be blueprints for how to set up such a thing yourself, inhouse. But reality shows that ODLs are often only used by their owners/administrators.

ODLs not being used by external people has to do with convenience and also with access to development infrastructure, which is mostly only available within a company. That’s why companies started assembling their own device labs — sometimes opening it up to others, thereby creating a new ODL.</blockquote>

Andre adds:
<blockquote>In general, ODLs located at companies see way lower public usage as compared to ODLs in public places, like co-working spaces, libraries, or places that have been built solely for running the ODL. Privacy and competition are to be taken into account, this is where some companies posted excellent upfront statements and provided physical space separate from their regular offices — others didn’t.</blockquote>

ODLs are particularly popular in the UK and Germany, with other such labs popping up around the world. Whether you want to call them ODLs or IDLs, the need to test on physical devices seems unlikely to lose momentum.

Here are some of the best ODLs for the developer community:

<strong>Address:</strong> CodeBase, Argyle House, 38 Castle Terrace, Edinburgh, EH1 2EL, UK

This is one of the few labs in the world that uses a charging model to keep the facility up to date with OS and hardware releases, with all the money made going back into keeping the lab open. This ODL is also exploring other tasks it can help the community with, like adding usability testing facilities for guerilla user testing, session recording and remote observation.

The lab offers free access for open-source and community projects, <em>ad-hoc</em> rates from £25 per hour for small businesses, and monthly subscriptions that help it maintain recurring revenue and stay open.

The team also built a private test lab for the Scottish government’s web team and is currently working on some interesting analytics tools for identifying the right test coverage for your audience.</p>

<strong>Address:</strong> 12 Basepoint, Andersons Road, Southampton, Hampshire, SO14 5FE, UK

With more than 25 devices, ranging from an iPhone 6 Plus to an old HTC Desire rocking Android 2.2, this ODL allows the local community to test on real devices, old and new, to make sure their projects work for as many people as possible.

This ODL is a big fan of progressive enhancement and encourages people to build resilient and inclusive websites. The relaxed and collaborative environment in the office also means that team members are on hand for advice.

Adam Tomat from the lab says, “We started the ODL because the local community is important to us. We recognised how difficult it is to test responsive websites without access to real devices and also how unfeasible it is for every individual or organisation to acquire a large enough selection. It’s been a great way for us to connect with new people, start conversations and help to build on the existing digital community here in Southampton.”

<strong>Address:</strong> Unit 1, George Street, Bridgend, CF31 3TS, UK

Cover-Up’s core business is creating innovative accessories for a selection of phones, tablets and laptops. As a result, for each new product range that it creates, it always buys the device, so that it can test firsthand. So, the company has a huge selection of gadgets that laid around for many years gathering dust — until its ODL was born.

The ODL now houses dozens of devices and is open 9:00 to 17:00, Monday to Friday. Just drop the team an email to book a spot at this ODL serving South Wales.</p>

<strong>Address:</strong> Indycube, 3rd Floor, 11 Wind Street, Swansea, SA1 1DP, UK

This lab holds a variety of screen sizes, from televisions down to watches, and also has devices of varying quality, from old monitors to HD screens. A selection of input types are available, such as trackpads, mice, styluses and screenreaders, installed to test for issues beyond just screen layout, which is a nice touch.

This balance of old and new devices is important, as Paul Burgess from the Indylab explains: “We shouldn’t assume that everyone is using the latest technology. Many people are using devices that haven’t been updated in a long time, so we include some older operating systems and pre-smartphone devices, as well as an iPod running a vintage iOS 2.2.1.”

<strong>Address:</strong> All over Cape Town, South Africa

The devices in this lab are chosen with its local (South African) users in mind and are updated every now and then based on research and statistics, which means the selection leans towards feature phones and lower-end smartphones.

The devices are purposefully kept relatively low in number but cover a wide range of variables (input method, form factor, quality and condition of hardware, device capabilities). The high-level categories that a device belongs to (for example, old Android, cheap smartphone) are more important than the device itself: The lab is aiming for support across a wide range of these variables. Its focus is to help people build “future-friendly things.”

A couple of devices in the lab might seem odd to include (like the Amazon Kindle Touch, the Sony Playstation Vita and the Nintendo 3DS XL) because these aren’t particularly popular devices for web browsing in South Africa, but they are a good way to testing your website on an old device and browser.</p>

<strong>Address:</strong> UXBERT Usability Lab, Al Nemer Center 1, Olaya Street, Riyadh 11372, Saudi Arabia

This state-of-the-art ODL is the only one in Saudi Arabia and only one of three in the Middle East. It’s located in the only commercial usability testing lab in Saudi Arabia and is equipped with the latest technology, including an Oculus Rift, eye-tracking tools and brain EEG control devices.

Large corporate, government and other businesses pay for Arabic UX and usability-testing consulting services based on a project’s requirements, but use of the ODL is completely free for unfunded startups and entrepreneurs. All the lab asks is that you book in advance to ensure that the lab and devices are available.

As well as testing for quality or bugs, visitors can also take advantage of its usability testing lab (depending on equipment availability) to test with real users and record those tests, but you need to bring your own users.

Nadeem Bakhsh, a senior UX, usability and ecommerce consultant at the UXBERT Usability Lab, sas, “Saudi’s tech startup community is young, but it’s full of ambitious people with innovative ideas. We started this device and usability lab to help support these startups to turn their ideas into reality. Using the lab, they not only get access to devices for testing, but can bounce ideas and get insights from our team of Arab UX, usability and ecommerce experts to help develop their ideas into wireframes, user journeys and prototypes.”
