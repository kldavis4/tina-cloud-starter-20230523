We’re opening up our Smashing TV webinars to everyone, and today you’re welcome to follow along as Rachel Andrew builds a layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox.

In the session, Rachel will be building a component of a layout, talking through her thinking as she does so. Is Flexbox or Grid the right method to use? How will the component respond to different screen sizes? And, what about those old browsers?

If you are a [Smashing Member](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/membership) then you will get the added benefit of being able to ask your own questions after the session.
