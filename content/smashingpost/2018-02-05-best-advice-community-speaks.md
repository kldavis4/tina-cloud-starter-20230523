The beginning of a new year seems like a perfect time to think about what we web professionals do, why we do it, how we could do it better and even how we could have more fun doing it.

Like everyone, we learn lessons as we make our way through life and work. If we’re lucky, we pick up some good advice along the way, so we thought it might be useful to find out what kind of advice you all have found to be particularly valuable.

This is how we framed the question on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/smashingmag/status/942674788438495232) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/smashmag/posts/10156027292532490).

<blockquote>Never overpromise. Always overdeliver by a bit. Accept critique first, think process it later. Never kill an idea in a meeting.

What was some of the most useful and wise advice you’ve received over all these years?</blockquote>

The responses we’ve received so far have organized themselves into several thematic groups (with some overlaps). Some advice focused exclusively on web work, some on work in general, and some on life in general.

## Get Stuff Done

The largest group of respondents focused on advice related to work process, quality, and outcomes, with an emphasis on pragmatism and getting things done. The strongest thread of advice in this group of comments acknowledged that if you keep working on something until it’s “perfect,” it’ll most likely never get done.  

This is particularly relevant for our industry because, to a greater or lesser extent, web professionals must often work in a self-directed way. Sure, we have deadlines, and KPIs, and benchmarks to meet, but the overall imperative is that the result must be good &mdash; usable, effective, aesthetically pleasing &mdash; and often we are the ones who have to say when something is “ready.”

The reality is that, notwithstanding user testing, we don’t really find out if something’s ready until it’s being used in the wild. So, make it good, get it out there, and then make it better based on user feedback.  

Let’s see what the community came up with.

## Believe In Yourself

Another popular work-related theme was advice about having confidence in your skills and making sure you receive reasonable remuneration for applying those skills.

While this applies to people in lots of different lines of work, it takes on a particular context in the web industry. Formal training and education are increasing, but many working web professionals rely on skills acquired “on the job” plus whatever videos and books they could get hold of.

In truth, skills acquired this way are no less than those gained from formal training. The proof lies in what you create.

What’s more, many people outside the industry still have this weird belief that web design and development is something that anyone could do. Consequently, web professionals may encounter situations where they are asked to work for low or no pay. Even now, those of us who have NOT been asked to work for nothing more than “the exposure” are few and far between.

Here’s what our readers suggested.

## Care About What You Do

There was some very good advice about how we think and feel about our work.

Some advice focused on undertaking work that you genuinely care about. That’s not always easy, in which case the two options are to learn to care about it or to get out and find something else you *do* care about.

When you do care about what you do, it becomes easier to reflect on how well you’re doing and what you need to do to do better.

Here’s some of the advice offered by our readers.

## Live Life

Some advice was quite generic in nature and widely applicable to work and life in general &mdash; and all the more useful for that. What these comments have in common is the awareness that life is not lived in a vacuum, and work is not the be-all and end-all.

Every person has the right to self-determination, which comes with the responsibility to put some thought into what you’re doing and make decisions that will not only support your ambitions but give you a lifestyle that is healthy and happy.

Here are some examples from the community.

    <tr>
        <th data-tablesaw-priority="persist">Tip</th>
        <th>Says Who</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>“Sometimes you have to close a door before a new one will open.”</td>
        <td><a href="https://twitter.com/@webilicious">Neil Robertson</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>“Never Stop Learning”</td>
        <td><a href="https://twitter.com/@KisanB">Kisan Bhat</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>“Your family is just as important as the work. Go home. The work will always be there when you return.”</td>
        <td><a href="https://twitter.com/@melharp2">Melanie Harper</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>“Time is yours. You have time and you choose how to spend it. Choose wisely and respect your own choices, even when taking time for yourself. One needs time for him/herself.”</td>
        <td><a href="https://twitter.com/@borisschapira">Boris</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>After accidentally missing curfew, my Dad said to me, “Son, there really are no accidents.” That has stayed with me... There’s failure to plan, failure to predict, failure to adapt, but very little of life’s mistakes are truly “accidents”. Talk about driving excellence!</td>

## Don’t Take Any Wooden Nickels

Our last group of responses is a grab bag of advice that may be more or less applicable to you, depending on your circumstances.

Yes, some of these are meant to be light-hearted (although some hint at rather dark personal experiences), but even joke responses can have nuggets of truth hidden in them.

By and large, this group of advice is about protecting yourself and avoiding negative restrictions.

See if you think this is good advice.

And there you have it. Quite a diverse set of comments, yet with some clear through lines and areas of common focus. Hopefully, there are a few nuggets of wisdom in that lot that strike a chord with you.

I’m going to leave you with a piece of advice about advice, attributed to Oscar Wilde:

<blockquote>The only thing to do with good advice is to pass it on. It is never of any use to oneself.</blockquote>

And on that note, if you feel inspired to add some advice you’ve received that has been powerful for you, please feel free to add them in the comments below, or jump on the [Twitter](https://twitter.com/smashingmag/status/942674788438495232) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/smashmag/posts/10156027292532490) threads.
