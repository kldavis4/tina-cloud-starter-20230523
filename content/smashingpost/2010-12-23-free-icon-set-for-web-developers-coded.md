### Behind the Design

Here are some insights from the designer:
<blockquote>"Coders and developers have unique responsibilities throughout each work week. From implementing client ideas, to expanding and coding personal endeavors, there's much work to do at any walk of a web developer's career. With this, there are tools a developer uses and trusts through these daily challenges. Inspired by such tools and the tasks they help tackle, this set has been crafted to fit the commonly used files, formats, and resources coders of any kind have come to rely. Whether used on your next client's site, or for accenting your own coding ventures, we're confident this free icon set will make an excellent addition to your library. Enjoy!"</blockquote>

Thanks, Thomas! We truly appreciate and respect your time and your efforts!
