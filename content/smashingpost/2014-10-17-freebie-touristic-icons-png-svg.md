### Insights From The Designers:

<blockquote>"These icons are trendy and present a good number of reference sites in regards to graphic design. Due to the fact that designers and developers have increasingly become quite demanding when choosing icons, we've chosen this line style to capture the elegance and cleanliness. The fluorescent colors are also in line with the trend and, in this case, are the best way to highlight line icons on black and white.

We created this icon set with a modern and minimalist style that contrasts with the traditional character of the photographs in black and white. They can be used to create logos to adorn websites, travel guides, and even video motion graphics. We've prepared them in vector format so that they can be used in any type of medium. You're welcome! ;)"</blockquote>
