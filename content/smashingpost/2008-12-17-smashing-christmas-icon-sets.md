## Smashing Christmas Icon Set

The Russian design studio <a href="https://www.softfacade.com">SoftFacade</a> has chosen a quite unusual approach in design of the Christmas icons set. They put a lot of efforts to come up with some really unusual approach. While the icons exhibit designers' close attention to the smallest details, they are also very colorful and can be used to decorate your weblog according to the Christmas theme.

The set includes 10 icons — RSS, Shopping cart, Portfolio, Comment, Links, User, Calendar, Contacts, Social networks and Print. The icons are available in resolutions 64×64px, 128×128px and as illustrations in formats .png and .ico. The icons were designed exclusively for Smashing Magazine and its readers as the gift to the design community for Christmas. <a href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/cd2b1b1d-d9fe-4e95-a39e-cfc0d88f3352/smashing-christmas-icons-set.zip">Download the set</a> (.zip, 1 Mb)

Here are some insights from the designers:

"We love Smashing Magazine and we read it regularly, which is why we were more than happy to design a Christmas icon set for the readers of Smashing Magazine. Together with the SM team we discussed what types of icons are more likely to be interesting and useful for a wide variety of SM readers, and decided to get creative to <strong>make the set literally stand out</strong>.

Afterwards we took some time to come up with metaphors that wouldn't be as common and as boring as most Christmas icons are. We really wanted to design something memorable and outstanding. Once the rought drafts were done, we started to design icons in Photoshop.

In the end, icons have become very colorful, very unusual and with <strong>close attention to the smallest details</strong> — and, in our opinion, it perfectly fits to the atmosphere of Smashing Magazine. We are confident that these icons will help Smashing readers to get into the festive Christmas mood and make their web-sites even more beautiful.

With love to design from Russia, SoftFacade design studio."

## Dock The Halls Icons Set

<a href="https://iampaddy.com">Paddy Donnelly</a>, a designer from Ballycastle, Northern Ireland, has asked himself: why not 'Christmassy' up your dock and hang up the Adobe family's stockings? This idea led to the 'Dock the Halls' icons set, a set of 20 icons that may put your dock or your blog in a festive mood. The Adobe Illustrator source file is available for free download as well.
