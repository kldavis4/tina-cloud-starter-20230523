  **Regular expressions** are an essential part of any programmer’s toolkit.
  They can be very handy when you need to identify, replace or modify text,
  words, patterns or characters. In a nutshell: regular expressions (regex) are
  like a Swiss army knife for modifying strings of just about anything. Need to
  make your site URLs look pretty? Use regex. Need to remove all punctuation
  from a sentence? Definitely use regex. The uses for regular expressions are
  almost limitless.

  Regular expressions are something that you’ll come across at least once in
  your development cycle, whether you’re just trying to modify an .htaccess file
  to make clean URLs, or something much more advanced like filtering RSS feeds
  or other data. Here are some **resources to get you well on your way to
  mastering regex**.

## Regex Tools

<a href="https://www.regex-tester.de/en,regex.html">regex online tester</a>
Regex allows you to test your regular expressions in different types of data in a variety of ways. For instance, you can directly check how your regular expressions are applied to a given web-page (URL) or text. History stores all the regular expressions you’ve created with the tool, so you can use a roll back once you’ve modified the expression in an incorrect way. Regex patterns, filters and modifiers help you to build the regular expression and test it immediately in the same window. Basic knowledge about regular expressions is required to use the tool.

A Crash-Course In Regular Expressions
An introductory crash-course by Jeffrey Way. A little bit outdated, but still useful tutorial that shows how to use regular expressions to check if an e-mail is valid or not. "To a novice web developer, regular expressions look like the most scary thing on the planet. Who could possibly dismantle such a block of code and decipher its meaning? Luckily, its bark is much worse than its bite. You’ll quickly find that regular expressions are rather straight-forward and easy to understand - once you learn the syntax."
