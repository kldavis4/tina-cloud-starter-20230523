## Insights From The Designer

<blockquote>“Office and business icons are kind of a subject that never dies. Every time I work on web design, I need some icons to explain things, and I always use icons to visualize something related to business. That’s the reason I created these two sets. I sincerely hope that they will be very useful for readers who work in graphic design and web design. You are <strong>free to customize the icons the way you want</strong>, and you will find it very easy to do because they are all well layered. It doesn’t matter whether you use Photoshop or Illustrator; you will find both file formats provided (AI and PSD).”</blockquote>

Thank you, dear <a href="https://www.manuelalangella.com">Manuella Langella</a>. We sincerely appreciate your time and effort! Keep up the brilliant work!
