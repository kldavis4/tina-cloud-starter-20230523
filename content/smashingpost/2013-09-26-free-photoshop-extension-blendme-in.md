There is no doubt that the Web is full of websites that are packed with free icon packs, and that doesn't necessarily make it easier for designers to find their way around when they're looking for a particular icon for a particular project. When you're in your creative zone and have an idea about something that would perfectly fit in your design, you don't have time to waste and struggle with finding the right asset.

BlendMe.in is a Photoshop extension that allows you to quickly find a high-quality icon that you can simply drag and drop and then easily continue your ideation. All of the icons are vectorial and have been inserted as smart Photoshop objects, meaning that you get all the icon components as layers (vector objects, adjustment layers, etc.) so that you can easily tweak them to match your creation.

## Behind The Design

As always, here are some insights from the designers:
<blockquote>"This extension started out as a solution to a problem that we as UX designers often have: we tend to use small parts of older UIs (especially in the mock-up phase) and the process can be quite frustrating. We kept asking ourselves, 'How difficult can it be to build an extension in which one can search layers from existing PSDs?' After several tries, we came up with something that we kept using repeatedly, not only because it was our own tool, but because it made our lives easier.

This extension only contains icons at the moment. We do, however, plan to grow the collection and include more asset types, including filters, effects and adjustment layers.

The content inside BlendMe.in is provided under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License</a> — with attribution. We're thinking of ways to make the attribution even more prominent by default, e.g. by automatically generating a text layer with thanks to all the asset authors that have/are being used. Designers pour hours of work into these high-quality collections which they release for free, and attribution is really the least we could do to give them the credit they deserve.

Speaking about thanks, we'd like to thank <a href="https://www.danielbruce.se/">Daniel Bruce</a> (Entypo) and <a href="https://visualidiot.com/">Visual Idiot</a> for their early support, and to all the creatives who're making part of their work available to others for re-use. Thank you!"</blockquote>

A big <strong>Thank You</strong> to the team at BlendMe.in for the fantastic Photoshop extension — we all sincerely appreciate your hard work!
