### Behind the design

As always, here are some insights from the designers:
<blockquote>There are a lot of free icon libraries out there, however, only few of them focus mainly on medical icons and we wanted this gap to be closed. Centigrade conducted quite a lot of icon projects in the healthcare sector just recently, for which reason we already had some nice vector shapes on the pile. We distilled the most frequently requested metaphors and wrapped them into a fresh new style. Being modern and concise rather than fancy and playful, they are in line with what we experienced works well in the medical domain.</blockquote>

Thank you very much, guys! We really appreciate your efforts.</p>
