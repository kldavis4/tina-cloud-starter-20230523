While there exist numerous data grid libraries with similar features out in the world, not all may adequately fit your business and app use cases. When choosing a suitable data grid library for your application, you must consider its feature set, performance, price, license, and support, among other factors. In this article, you’ll get a rundown of some popular data grid libraries that would be a great addition to any data-heavy application.    

But first, let’s break down what a data grid is. A data grid is a table component that usually loads, presents, and manipulates a large data set. They typically ship with extended functionality like data filtering, sorting, selection, streaming, aggregation, highly configurable columns and rows, and so on to help users better read and handle the massive dataset. More specialized data grids even embed other components like charts and enable in-table editing. Owing to the enormous data they handle, data grids are often built with efficiency and streamlined performance in mind. Moreover, they tend to be highly customizable and extendable to meet niche use cases related to the data they present. 

Data grids can be applied to a variety of use cases. For one, you could use them for simple tables while taking advantage of their enhanced search, filtering, aggregation, and functionality. Data grids can be essential on KPI dashboards to get a unified view of multiple indicators from several data sources. Another area they can be useful is on financial dashboards, where tracking and visualizing accounting and financial information is crucial. Data grids can also be helpful in inventory management systems to track and manage goods, orders, sales, and other commercial operations. These are just a few use cases they can be instrumental in. 

This article will run down a list of popular data grid libraries specialized for handling large datasets. They will be evaluated on a number of different factors: 

- Feature set,
- Price,
- Licensing options and open source status,
- Frontend framework support,
- Ease of customization and extensibility,
- Performance,
- Documentation, learning resources, community, and offered support.

## Conclusion

Data grids are essential in developing any modern SaaS or internal business-critical applications. A good table component should offer advanced functionality like configurable cells, rows, and columns, sorting, filtering, grouping, summaries, and so on. Data grids mainly improve the readability and make the manipulation of large datasets easier. Professional data grids should also be able to handle massive amounts of data without degrading your app’s performance. They also need to be customizable and extensible to fit niche use cases related to the data they present. When choosing a data grid library, you have to consider the frameworks it works with, pricing, licensing, technical support, and whether its feature set fits your business needs.
