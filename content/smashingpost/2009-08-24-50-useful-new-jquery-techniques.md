jQuery has an additional advantage in that it allows developers to select elements on a page using CSS-like syntax.

To help you improve your skills, in this article we present <strong>50 useful new jQuery techniques and tutorials</strong> that have been created recently and that could make the development of your next website an easier and more interesting experience than the last.</p>

## 50 Useful jQuery Techniques

<a href="https://css-tricks.com/moving-boxes/">Moving Boxes Carousel with jQuery</a>
Many of the concepts presented in classic carousel tutorials are the same, so this tutorial will not throw a lot of source code at you. The big difference here is that there are buttons to change panels and the panels zoom in and out.

{{% feature-panel %}}

<a href="https://buildinternet.com/2009/03/sliding-boxes-and-captions-with-jquery/">Sliding Boxes and Captions with jQuery</a>
All of these sliding box animations work on the same basic idea. There is a div tag (.boxgrid in my css) that essentially acts as a window where two other items of your choosing “peek” through.

Accessible Charts &amp; Graphs from Table Elements using HTML 5 Canvas and jQuery
This technique provides a simple method for generating bar, line, area, and pie charts from an HTML table, and allows you to configure them in a variety of ways.

<a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2009/03/31/make-a-mega-drop-down-menu-with-jquery/">Make a Mega Drop-Down Menu with jQuery</a>
So how would we go about implementing Mega drop down menus? While it’d be great to do all of this in pure HTML and CSS, it’s impossible at the moment to get those nice half-second delays — and of course there’s a pesky problem with Internet Explorer 6, which only supports :hover on anchor elements. Instead, I’ve whipped up a solution using jQuery and a very nifty plugin called hoverIntent.

<a href="https://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/creating-a-filterable-portfolio-with-jquery/">Creating a Filterable Portfolio with jQuery</a>
If you have worked in your field for a while, there is a pretty good chance that you have a rather extensive portfolio. To make it a little easier to navigate, you will probably be tempted to break them into different categories. In this tutorial, I will show you how to make "filtering by category" a little more interesting with just a little bit of jQuery.

"This example makes use of several techniques: MySQL (for the database), HTML/CSS for styling, PHP for retrieving the data and jQuery for the AJAX request. How about that for some nice way of combining powerful techniques to create something nice like this. You do need some basic knowledge about these techniques to fully understand this tutorial."

<a href="https://css-tricks.com/improved-current-field-highlighting-in-forms/">Current Field Highlighting</a>
As a matter of usability and aesthetics, it is a good thing to add some kind of visual feedback on web forms to indicate the currently active (or “focused“) field. In this tutorial, we'll improve our current field highlighting, using jQuery.

[![Current Field Highlighting](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/06b1eeb8-5cd0-4653-9b3b-26b0c9efe053/highl.gif)](https://css-tricks.com/improved-current-field-highlighting-in-forms/)

<a href="https://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/creating-a-dynamic-poll-with-jquery-and-php/">Creating a Dynamic Poll with jQuery and PHP</a>
"When you combine some neat functionality courtesy of PHP with the cleverness of jQuery you can produce some pretty cool results. In this tutorial we'll create a poll using PHP and XHTML, then make use of some jQuery Ajax effects to eliminate the need for a page refresh, and to give it a nice little bit of animation."

jQuery Infinite Carousel
This screencast explains how you can create a simple and nice scrolling carousel and how you can also make it automatically loop round by itself. For the latter see also Automatic Infinite Carousel.

Better form submission feedback with jQuery
Browsers fail to give users effective feedback when the user submits a form. Users respond by clicking the submit button over and over. The problem compounds when users find out they’ve been charged 5 times or when you receive 5 contact submissions. The solution is to replace the submit button with a friendly message letting the user know the form is working.

<a href="https://buildinternet.com/2009/06/how-to-make-a-threadless-style-t-shirt-gallery/">How to Make a Threadless Style T-Shirt Gallery</a>
Here’s the gist: There’s a thumbnail which is a full sized image in a container div, which is smaller than the full sized image. The image is centered within it, but doesn’t show entirely because overflow:hidden is turned on. When the mouse hovers over the thumbnail, overflow:hidden gets turned off, and the entire image is displayed.

Create a gallery by using z-index and jQuery
In this tutorial you will learn to combine the CSS property ‘z-index’ and the power of jQuery to create a unique gallery which have a appearance of a pile of pictures. Also check out Enhancing the z-index Gallery with a Preloader.

<a href="https://liviuholhos.com/blog/add-a-favicon-near-external-links-with-jquery">Add a favicon near external links with jQuery</a>
External links should always be marked distinctly in order to make it easy for readers to see them easily. You cann add a CSS class to all outgoing links using the pseudo-class <code>a[href^=http]</code>. A more dynamic solution is using the favicon.ico of the external site, if it is available of course.

Scrollable Timelines
Making use of the overflow and scrollLeft DOM property to scroll elements is a much more effective use of the CPU, over animating using CSS top/left. This tutorial demonstrates the same effect used in two completely different ways.

![Timeline](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f6dfb6da-6524-43ee-88d3-de6fe6a5b234/timeline.gif)

<a href="https://www.jankoatwarpspeed.com/post/2009/08/20/Table-of-contents-using-jQuery.aspx">Automatically generate table of contents using jQuery</a>
"Some time ago, I was debating with my friends on the topic: is there any use of generating table of contents automatically. The conclusion was that it can be useful in cases when the reading material is long enough and table of contents (TOC) has a fixed position on the screen. This tutorial will show you how to create such TOC in just a few lines of code."

In this tutorial we're going to be using the jQuery UI slider widget to create an attractive and functional content slider. We'll have a container, which has a series of elements each containing different blocks of content. There will be too many of these elements to display at once, so we can use the slider to move the different content blocks in and out of view.

We are going to make a digg-style post sharing toolbox. It's all pretty straight forward and need a little bit of planning. The way it works is different with digg's. If you view the html source code of Digg's, it has the sharebox html code in every single post. But, in this tutorial we have only one sharebox, and all the links are sharing the same template.

<a href="https://ejohn.org/blog/retweet/">Easy Retweet Button</a>
Ever since I saw the Bit.ly JavaScript API I've been wanting to build a simple script for tracking the number of people visiting a blog post from Twitter. This past weekend I built a little script for doing just that - and in a completely unobtrusive manner. The script itself is completely standalone (no dependencies) and can be included in any page relatively painlessly. Additionally, since it's just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it's completely themeable and customizable to the style of your site.

Automated image preloading for a snappy UI
We developed a solution that automates the age-old task of preloading images in web applications. It uses javascript and is packaged as a jQuery plugin, but the concept could easily be ported to other libraries or plain old Javascript as well.

I nice little additive to web forms is to put the input labels inside of the inputs box as the starting value. By using jQuery to bring the label in as the value we can archive the desired effect without impacting accessibility, since the label elements are still there. Then we can take it a step further by dynamically adding a class to the input and use CSS to style the form only if JavaScript is enabled. The search box at the top of this page is an example of this technique.

When it comes to form validation, it's hard to have a versatile solution that works with every form. Figuring out how to display errors is not a simple task. This is something I tried to remedy with this script. When an error needs to be displayed, the script creates a div and positions it in the top right corner of the input. This way you don't have to worry about your HTML form structure. The rounded corner and shadow are done with CSS3 and degrade well in non compliant browsers. There is no images needed.

The youlove.us scrolling background effect explained
The technique is actually a lot simpler than it looks, it's based around scrolling a very tall gradient image behind some transparent PNG images. The header image (with our logo, strapline and the laptop) has a transparent background and solid text, while the main page is actually an image with the heading text as transparent cut outs.

jQuery File Tree
jQuery File Tree is a configurable, AJAX file browser plugin for jQuery. You can create a customized, fully-interactive file tree with as little as one line of JavaScript code.

It makes sense to forgo database tables and server-side code when you need to store a limited amount of non-sensitive data. Accessing this data can be a snap with jQuery because the library was built to traverse XML documents with ease. With some custom JavaScript and jQuery magic you can create some interesting widgets. A good way to demonstrate this functionality is by building a browsable Amazon.com books widget.

jParallax turns a selected element into a window, or viewport, and all its children into absolutely positioned layers that can be seen through the viewport. These layers move in response to the mouse, and, depending on their dimensions (and options for layer initialisation), they move by different amounts, in a parallaxy kind of way.

When a webpage is designed to display large tables of data, a great amount of consideration should be dedicated to allowing the user to sort through the data in a structured manner. In this article, I will go over four techniques: hover effects, zebra rows, filtering, and sorting.

In this tutorial, we're going to be building an image scroller, making use of jQuery's excellent animation features and generally having some fun with code. Image scrollers are of course nothing new; versions of them come out all the time. Many of them however are user-initiated; meaning that in order for the currently displayed content to change, the visitor must click a button or perform some other action. This scroller will be different in that it will be completely autonomous and will begin scrolling once the page loads.

SpriteMenu
This is a method of putting together a nice-looking menu in a very quick and easy way. It uses a technique known as CSS Sprites. Instead of trying to manage huge amounts of images, everything is packed into just one file, which means the browser will only have to download one file instead of making multiple requests, and its just a lot easier to manage. The menu is displayed by manipulating the background-position property to display individual sprites in the image. There are no drop-downs attached to the menu, but it shouldn't be hard to add them in which I may do in the future.

We're going to tell the script to loop through all of the comments on the page. If the member link on the current comment matches the member link in the profile, then it must be an author comment. The script will then apply an additional class to the comment, allowing you to style it separately.

Just about every website uses the regular navigation concepts we're all used to. After awhile this can get pretty boring, especially for designers who thrive on creativity. While mimicking the OS X dock and stacks isn't new, it's certainly not common

Studies show that top navigations tend to get the most visual attention when a user first visits a site. Having organized and intuitive navigation is key × and while most drop down menus may look aesthetically pleasing, developing them to degrade gracefully is also essential. In this tutorial I would like to go over how to create a sexy drop down menu that can also degrade gracefully.

Placing pictures on simple polaroids on a webpage simply didn't do it for me. I wanted to drag them around, rotate them and still have a fun time. That's were CSS and jQuery come in play. By combining the CSS3 Box Shadow and Rotate properties, this effect is relatively easy to create. When dragging a polaroid around, you'll see the shadow. When it's placed down, it's rotated to the left or the right (random).
