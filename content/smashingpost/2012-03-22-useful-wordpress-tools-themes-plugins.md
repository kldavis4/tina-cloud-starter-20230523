## WordPress Plugins

Besides themes, plugins are another way to customize your WordPress website with advanced functionality and interactivity. As with themes, there are plugins for just about everything you can possibly imagine. But also like themes, it can be difficult to sift through the fluff, and find those gems that truly <em>improve</em> your website.

When you do find a WordPress plugin that's great, you just have to share it with others in the community. So put on your plugin-checking goggles, because it's about to get interesting!

<a href="https://wpcandy.com/broadcasts/the-sweet-plugin/user-switching">The Sweet Plugin: User Switching</a>
Today’s Sweet Plugin is User Switching, which has quickly become one of my all-time favorite plugins. It allows admins to easily switch to another user, skipping the log-in / log-out process, which can become quite time-consuming for testing the websites of different users. This is one plugin that is seriously worth checking out.

<a href="https://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/">Bcrypt WordPress Plugin: Store A Password Safely</a>
bcrypt uses a variant of the Blowfish encryption algorithm’s keying schedule, and introduces a work factor, which allows you to determine how expensive the hash function will be. Because of this, bcrypt can keep up with Moore’s law. As computers get faster, you can increase the work factor and the hash will get slower.
