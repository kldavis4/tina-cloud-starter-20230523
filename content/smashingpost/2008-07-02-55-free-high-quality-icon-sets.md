The design took place in 3ds max and the rendering was done with Vray.

## Pacman Returns Icon Set

We have found the Russian design studio <a href="https://www.turbomilk.com">Turbomilk</a> a long time ago. Denis Kortunov and his team published a couple of truly useful articles related to icons design. We've been impressed by thte quality of their work and contacted them, asking to design an unusual and creative icon set. We've discussed what exactly we would like to have and let the designers do the magic. In the end the result was a set of unusual avatars, similar to the legendary PacMan. We love the icons, and hopefully so are you!

The set "Pacman Returns" contains 11 high-quality icons (including RSS and "Smashing Pacman"-icons) that you can use for free in your private and commercial projects - without any restrictions whatsoever.

## Nurture Social Icon Set

This is definitely one of the last social icon sets we release here, on Smashing Magazine. Since we've released a lot of "social" sets throughout 2008, we decided to not release such sets in the future – unless the quality is truly outstanding. The latter is the case in <a href="https://www.tutorial9.net">David Leggett</a>'s social icon set called "Nurture". We just couldn't reject David's great work which is why we release it in this post, even although some commenters may not like it.

"Nurture" is a Social Icon Pack that was designed for digital creatives who want to add a unique, lively, and green touch to their blogs and other web-projects. The set includes 10 icons featuring the logos of popular social bookmarking sites. The set was designed with a fresh, lively, green look in mind. The pack includes 512x512, 256x256, 128x128, and 64x64 icons in .png format. It can be used for free in any commercial or private projects with no restrictions, but the set itself may not be resold, sublicensed, rented, transferred or otherwise made available for use.

## Nurture Social Icon Set

This is definitely one of the last social icon sets we release here, on Smashing Magazine. Since we've released a lot of "social" sets throughout 2008, we decided to not release such sets in the future – unless the quality is truly outstanding. The latter is the case in <a href="https://www.tutorial9.net">David Leggett</a>'s social icon set called "Nurture". We just couldn't reject David's great work which is why we release it in this post, even although some commenters may not like it.

"Nurture" is a Social Icon Pack that was designed for digital creatives who want to add a unique, lively, and green touch to their blogs and other web-projects. The set includes 10 icons featuring the logos of popular social bookmarking sites. The set was designed with a fresh, lively, green look in mind. The pack includes 512x512, 256x256, 128x128, and 64x64 icons in .png format. It can be used for free in any commercial or private projects with no restrictions, but the set itself may not be resold, sublicensed, rented, transferred or otherwise made available for use.
