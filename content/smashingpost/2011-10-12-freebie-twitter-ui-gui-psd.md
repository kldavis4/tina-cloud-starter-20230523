### Behind the Design

As always, here are some insights from the designer:
<blockquote>"Time after time I dealt with the <strong>headache of updating my Twitter profiles</strong>. After searching thoroughly for an alternative to editing live, it was clear that there weren't any great solutions or intentions by anyone to create a pixel-perfect template for anyone to use. Not to mention, a template that would remain up-to-date as the website evolved.

This PSD includes grouped elements by name respective of their location in the HTML of Twitter.com. The profile images utilize smart objects to ease the pain of changing images. Update the image once and it will <strong>proportionally scale the images across the whole PSD</strong>. Hope this template makes mocking up your profile a lot easier. Enjoy!"</blockquote>

Thank you, Shelby White. We appreciate your work and your good intentions.</p>
