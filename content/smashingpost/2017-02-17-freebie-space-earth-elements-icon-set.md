### Insights From The Designers

<blockquote>"Nature is always inspiring. Whether it’s space, with its stars and Sun, or our home planet with its waterfalls and mountains, our design team is always motivated by what surrounds us. And that includes technology. From planes to submarines, we can explore our world with their help. We wanted to create a freebie that showed it so we made this elements set, called From Space to Earth.

It contains elements and icons with everything from rockets and asteroids to planes, fishes and even some dinosaur bones. We hope you get inspired to create some art of your own. Grab everything you need from this freebie and start creating!"</blockquote>
