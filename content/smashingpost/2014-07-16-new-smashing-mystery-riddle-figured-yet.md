To celebrate the launch of the <a href="https://www.smashingconf.com/whistler-2014/">SmashingConf Whistler</a>, our very first conference in Canada, we’ve prepared a yet another riddle, and of course this time it's not going to be any easier!

So, how does it work this time? Well, below you'll find the first of a few <strong>hidden animated GIFs that contain a secret Twitter hashtag</strong>. Your job is to construct that hashtag as fast as possible. To do that, you have to pay attention to the file name and <strong>count objects</strong> within the GIF (for example, "3 chairs") and search for them on Twitter (i.e. <code>#3chairs</code>).

If your guess is right, you'll find a tweet leading you to the next level. Once you've reached the last level (oh, you'll know when), just <strong>tweet out all the hints in one single hashtag</strong> to <a href="https://twitter.com/smashingmag">@smashingmag</a> on Twitter! Not <em>that</em> difficult, right?

Alright, let's get to business. Are you ready? Action! (And good luck!)
