The beauty of **code snippets** is their ability to save you time when developing a site. Whether you keep a file with your own often-reused snippets or turn to one of the many online repositories, snippets can really speed up your site development.

There are plenty of places online to find code snippets and **get answers to your coding questions**. And many of these places let you upload your own snippets, either for personal use or to share with the community. They can also be a great place to find inspiration if you're trying to figure out the best approach for any aspect of your site's development.

## 1. General Snippet Repositories and Resources

<p>The repositories and resources featured below cover multiple languages and platforms. Some have thousands of code snippets while others might only have a couple hundred.
