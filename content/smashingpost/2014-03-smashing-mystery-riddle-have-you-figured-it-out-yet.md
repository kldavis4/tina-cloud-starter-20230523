By now, you might actually know how it works. The good ol' Smashing Mysteries: <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-smashing-book-mystery-is-resolved-gifs-crazy-people-all-that-malarkey/">the door that would never open</a> and <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-new-smashing-mystery-riddle-smashingconf-ny/">the rain that would never stop</a>. Well, the Mystery continues! To celebrate the launch of Paul Boag's <em>Digital Adaptaion</em> book, weâ€™ve prepared a new riddle, and this time it's a bit different and a bit easier.

How does it work? Below you'll find <strong>three animated GIFs that contain a hidden message</strong>. Each GIF contains a few scattered letters (all uppercase) that you can use to build words. Once you put the words from all the GIFs together, you will be able to create a sentence. Please notice that no letters should be left unused. Once you've resolved the mystery, please tweet the full sentence using the hashtag <code>#smashing</code>.

#### Are you ready? Action!

Watch out for the clues in the descriptions under each animation. Remember: <strong>the key is to build one meaningful sentence out of the words</strong> scattered all across the GIFs.
