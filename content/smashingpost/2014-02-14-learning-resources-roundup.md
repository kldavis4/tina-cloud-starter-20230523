Since learning is a lifelong task that doesn’t stop after pursuing a certain academic certificate, this round-up is not only dedicated to beginners. It’s for everyone who wants to become an expert in a certain field or is simply curious about the Web and the latest tools and techniques around them.

We hope that this round-up will bring you closer with many of the valuable resources that are available out there. Some are completely free while others can be obtained through quite affordable memberships. You may also be surprised to find that your local college or university is also publishing free classes and courses on all sorts of topics you can think of — make sure to keep an eye open!

Here are the topics of learning resources we’ll cover today:

*   [Coding Resources](#a1)
*   [Design Resources](#a2)
*   [Miscellaneous Lessons From The Web Industry](#a3)
*   [Expanding Your General Knowledge](#a4)
