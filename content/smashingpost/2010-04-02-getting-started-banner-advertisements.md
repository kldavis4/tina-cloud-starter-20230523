### Size

Every website is going to have its own requirements when it comes to the size of an ad. Typically these sizes are going to be standard sizes set by the many years of practice and existence online. These sizes can often be found present in many different graphic software programs, including Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Flash. Over time ad sizes have changed slightly, with the dismissal of pop-up advertisements, however the general sizes have become rudimentary consistent.

Determining what ad size will be the most beneficial depends on the product or services of which you are advertising. Ideally, you want to reserve two-thirds of the ad for a picture or the main <strong>value proposition</strong>. The other third should be dedicated to the primary <strong>call to action</strong>. In the chart to follow you will see the most common ad sizes, of which are strongly recommended for creating any banner ad.</p>

### Position

As with ad sizes, the position of an ad is entirely up to the website itself, however there have become common standards used across the Internet. Studies have proven that the most successful ad positions are within the <strong>content</strong> (44.66% response), within the <strong>heading</strong> (27.32% response), within the left (7.88% response) and right (9.28% response columns, rounded out by rotating ads (4.74% response) and ads below the fold (1.93% response). Generally speaking, ads close to the content, above the fold, and near other captivating content will provide optimal performance.

## Banner Ad Best Practices

### Have a Strong Heading

Immediately grab a user’s interest with a strong heading. If you are selling pet supplies a heading such as “Look Here!” will not fair as well as “Pet Supplies Specials”. Entice users with a <strong>short, captivating heading</strong> and draw them into your advertisement. Use a variation of font sizes and colors, different from the rest of the ad, to really place an emphasis on the heading.</p>

### Creative Copy

Users are drawn to creative copy such as “Free”, “On Sale”, “Today Only”, and so forth. Use intriguing copy that will support the heading. Keep the message short and to the point while providing enough information. Capture their attention then <strong>quickly deliver the message</strong>.</p>

### Display Pertinent Content and Images

In order for your ad to stand out against the rest of the content on a page you may want to spruce it up with a little visual content and/or images. When doing so, make sure that the content and images are relevant to that of what the ad is promoting. A beautiful scantily dressed lady will surely attract attention and click-throughs, but it is not going to do much good when trying to sell pest control services. Content and images have to <strong>be on target</strong> with that of the advertisement.</p>

### Have a Strong Call to Action

Every banner ad needs to have a strong call to action in order to work. Believe it or not, some users may see your ad similar as to how they see an ad on the side of a road. They observe the advertisement and store it within their memory bank, not knowing that the ad is clickable. Speak out to the user and tell them to “Click to See Home Lighting Specials” or whatever the ad is promoting. Also, make sure that your call to action is <strong>visually engaging</strong> within its <a title="Designing a Strong Call to Action" href="https://www.shayhowe.com/web-design/designing-call-to-action/">size, shape, and color</a> by using bright colors and an instinctively clickable shape.</p>

### Limit One Offer per Ad

Throwing too much at a user at a time will only confuse then, allowing them to miss your offer altogether. Before listing out every single product variation that is on sale think about using the text “All Sizes &amp; Styles on Sale” instead. It is <strong>more attractive</strong> to the user and accomplishes the same task quicker. If it is pertinent to list all of the products it may be beneficial to run multiple ads within the same campaign.</p>

### Optimize File Size

The recommended maximum file size for a banner ad is anywhere between 10k and 40k, all depending on the size dimensions of the banner. The <strong>smaller the better</strong>, but by adding multiple colors, images, and animations the file size can quickly add up. Remember, the smaller your file size is the quicker your ad is able to show up on a page, thus giving you a better opportunity to grab a use’rs attention.</p>

### Use Animations and Motion

Users are quickly drawn to animation and motion within a page, and because so animated banner ads greatly <strong>outperform static banners</strong>. Sliding, fading, blink, and other motions will immediately grab a user’s attention, however too much will annoy them. Use visually pleasing animations, of which are completely finished with the course of no more than 15 seconds. As a precaution, the more animations you use the larger your file size will become.</p>

### Blend In and Compliment

When designing a banner ad for a specific website use colors that will blend in and compliment that of the website being advertised. Making an ad look like that of the website itself will increase trust within the ad, <strong>provoking more users</strong> to click on it. If an ad is too contrasting and sticks out like a sore thumb users tend to be turned off as they know that they are trying to be sold something. Blend in and earn the users trust.</p>

### Run More than One Ad per Campaign

It is difficult to measure the success of a campaign based off of one banner alone. Every website is going to have a different audience of which will react differently to a banner. Create multiple banners for the same campaign and test them against one another. As time progresses mix up variations of the banners to <strong>create the best performing banners</strong> from one website to another website.</p>

### Measure Your Success

The only way to know if your banners are working is to measure your success. Create reports to see which banners have the highest click-through rate, what websites produce the highest amount of conversions, and so forth. Take note of what is working and what is not. Drop certain elements that are not working up to par and implement elements that are working into other banners. <strong>Make adjustments</strong> to your campaign upon measuring your success, then measure your success again and repeat as necessary.
