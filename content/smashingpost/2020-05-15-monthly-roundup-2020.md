In these current strange times of isolation and social distancing (with almost all events and conferences being cancelled), it can be quite difficult to feel connected to family, friends and colleagues. Here at Smashing, we believe that is is now more important than ever to stay in touch and support each other. Behind the scenes, the team is working tirelessly on ways to keep the community connected, and oh boy do we have a lot of things in store for you! You didn’t really think we’d give up that easily, did you?

We’ll help you boost your skills online and learn practical, actionable insights from experts in the industry.</figcaption></figure>

We’ve been busy over the last few weeks, and we’re not stopping yet! We have <a href="#online-workshops">online workshops</a>, <a href="#smashingconf-live">SmashingConf Live</a>, <a href="#smashing-meets">Smashing Meets</a> and last but not least, <a href="#smashing-tv">Smashing TV</a> coming right at your fingertips! But first, let’s see what else we’ve been up to...

## Look What’s Cookin’!

Exciting times! [*Click!*](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/printed-books/click/), our latest Smashing book, is available for pre-order with a friendly discount &mdash; you can already start reading the eBook until your printed copy arrives at your doorstep. Written by Paul Boag and beautifully designed by Veerle Pieters, the book is split into 11 chapters: from exploring the psychology of decision making and how to measure conversion to exploring ways of how to encourage users to act without alienating them.

<figure style="margin-bottom:0;padding-bottom:0" class="break-out article__image"><a href="https://smashed.by/click" title="Table of contents of the upcoming new Smashing book named Click!"><img style="border-radius:11px;" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a20c7d59-8824-475e-9494-407bd7861e49/click-smashing-book-toc-preview-blue-bgd.png"></a><figcaption class="center">There is no shortage of books on marketing and UX, but when it comes to bridging the gap between the two, many of us struggle to find the right balance. <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/05/encouraging-clicks-book-pre-release/">Pre-order today&nbsp;&rarr;</a></figcaption></figure>

Of course, if you’re feeling smashing today, we’d like to invite you <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/membership/">join the Smashing family</a> and <strong>get the eBook for free</strong> (among with many other eBooks and a few fancy cats!).

## Learning And Networking, The Smashing Way

Despite the current circumstances, we’re keen to find ways in which we can offer Smashing experiences to anyone interested in learning from experts in our industry &mdash; without needing to leave your desk! We’ve been asking what type of resources you’d like to have, and so all of the following online events is what has landed in our Smashing wishing well. Thank you to everyone who has shared their thoughts and feedback &mdash; we’ve been all ears!

### Creating Accessible Color Palettes

<p>Finding the perfect tint or shade of a color is not only a matter of taste but also accessibility. After all, if color contrast is lacking, a product could, in the worst case, even become unusable for people with vision impairments. A very detailed contrast checker to help you detect potential pitfalls ahead of time comes from Gianluca Gini: <a href="https://geenes.app/user-interface">Geenes</a>.</p>

<figure><a title="Geenes" href="https://geenes.app/user-interface"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://mcusercontent.com/16b832d9ad4b28edf261f34df/images/0c4f0d35-52bd-4798-87c3-6dcc70af6792.png" alt="Geenes" border="0"></a></figure>

<p>The tool lets you tinker with hue ranges and saturation and apply the color palettes to one of three selectable UI mockups. Once applied, you can trigger different kinds of vision impairments to see how affected people see the colors and, finally, make an informed decision on the best tones for your palette. To use the colors right away, just copy and paste their code or export them to Sketch.</p>

### Command Line Love

<p>It’s not uncommon for technical documentation to be dry and feel intimidating, especially for people who are just getting started with a new tool. That can get quite frustrating especially when a manual is difficult to read or follow, or the explanations are verbose and lack examples.</p>

<figure><a title="Dash Dash" href="https://dashdash.io/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://mcusercontent.com/16b832d9ad4b28edf261f34df/images/faa4a69f-4e15-477c-b080-b021186b9623.png" alt="Dash Dash" border="0"></a></figure>

<p><a href="https://dashdash.io/">Dash Dash</a> takes the Unix (Linux, BSD, macOS) open source manual pages and sets the content in a beautiful type and layout. It provides not only explanations of all commands, but also search, examples and TL;DR sections. Also, <a href="https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line">The Art of Command Line</a> takes you on a journey to Command Line from basics to system debugging.</p>
<p>And if you are up for advanced command line techniques, <a href="https://cmdchallenge.com">cmdchallenge</a> prompts you to solve tasks with a single line of bash. <em>(vf)</em></p>

### Accessible Component Libraries

<p>While many of the component libraries we create are trying to cover all the usual suspects (the accordions, the tables, the carousels, the drop-downs, along with typography, colors and box shadows), <a href="https://nostyle.herokuapp.com/">No Style Design System</a> by Adam Silver is focused primarily around accessibility and web forms.</p>

<figure><a title="Accessible Component Libraries" href="https://nostyle.herokuapp.com/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://mcusercontent.com/16b832d9ad4b28edf261f34df/images/7c13b3ef-ccd7-49de-b20c-8cd977a989a5.png" alt="Accessible Component Libraries" border="0"></a></figure>

<p>As a system created for and used in his book on <a href="https://formdesignpatterns.com/">Form Design Patterns</a>, Adam’s library provides a set of accessible components for everything from autocomplete, checkboxes and password reveal to radios, select boxes and steppers. Most of them have a minimal CSS styling with clean, accessible markup. And if you need slightly more advanced components, Heydon Pickering’s <a href="https://inclusive-components.design/">Inclusive Components</a> has got your back: with comprehensive tutorials on accessible cards, data tables, notifications, sliders, tabbed inerfaces, tooltips, menus and toggles. <em>(vf)</em></p>

### Custom CSS Cascades

<p>Miriam Suzanne built a demo to illustrate a <a href="https://codepen.io/mirisuzanne/pen/vYNgodb">very clever way to define a cascade of custom properties</a>. One that allows you to determine which intent should take priority, without worrying about the specificity of how the value is defined.</p>

{{< codepen height="480" theme_id="light" slug_hash="JjYawPP" default_tab="result" user="smashingmag" editable="true" data-editable="true" >}}See the Pen [Custom Cascades](https://codepen.io/smashingmag/pen/JjYawPP) by <a href="https://codepen.io/mirisuzanne">Miriam Suzanne</a>.{{< /codepen >}}

<p>Miriam shows how it works at the example of a button. Due to how the cascade is arranged, the default button is always falling back to <code>--btn-bg--default</code>. Adding the <code>disabled</code> attribute, always overrides any other button colors, no matter where they are defined, and, when new button types are created, <code>--btn-bg--type</code> ensures that only the defaults are overridden but not the state. The approach also lets you set these values contextually. A smart solution to avoid the usual dangers that highly-specified inline styles usually bring along.</p>

### Front-End Bookmarks

<p>Some of us save all the useful articles and talks they come across in one ever-growing bookmark folder (which can make finding what you’re looking for quite a challenge at times), others have a more organized approach. Like Manuel Matuzović.</p>

<figure><a title="Front-End Bookmarks" href="https://www.frontendbookmarks.com/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://mcusercontent.com/16b832d9ad4b28edf261f34df/images/9e8b5738-65ae-4990-a16b-023baf375592.png" alt="Front-End Bookmarks" border="0"></a></figure>

<p>Manuel collects articles and talks about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on his site <a href="https://www.frontendbookmarks.com/">Front-End Bookmarks</a>, grouped alphabetically by elements, attributes, properties, selectors, methods, and expressions. No matter if you’re looking for information on how to correctly use <code>aria-labelledby</code> or what the <code>::marker</code> pseudo-element is all about, chances are good that Manuel already compiled helpful resources on the topic. By the way, if you feel that a resource is missing in the collection, don’t hesitate to <a href="https://github.com/matuzo/front-end-bookmarks/#contributing">contribute to it on GitHub</a>.</p>

### GitHub Tips And Tricks

<p>Do you know how to automatically squash commits on GitHub when merging pull requests? Or how to open a repo in the browser using GitHub CLI? If not, Joe Previte’s <a href="https://egghead.io/playlists/github-tips-tricks-6fc4">collection of GitHub tips and tricks</a> might be for you.</p>

<figure><a title="GitHub Tips And Tricks" href="https://egghead.io/playlists/github-tips-tricks-6fc4"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://mcusercontent.com/16b832d9ad4b28edf261f34df/images/a946b208-6d32-4c5f-a904-28a4b424784b.png" alt="GitHub Tips And Tricks" border="0"></a></figure>

<p>In bite-sized videos, Joe shares small but powerful tips to take your GitHub workflow to the next level. And for those of you who prefer to learn by reading, most tips are also available as short blog posts. Handy little timesavers.</p>

### The Sound Of Colleagues

<p>Working from home can have some real advantages over working from an office, but let’s be honest, it can be a rather lonely experience, too, when there are no colleagues around. If you feel your home office is getting too quiet and you need some bustle in the background to stay focused, <a href="https://soundofcolleagues.com/"><em>The Sound of Colleagues</em></a> has got your back.</p>

<figure><a title="The Sound Of Colleagues" href="https://soundofcolleagues.com/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://mcusercontent.com/16b832d9ad4b28edf261f34df/images/fce5f9f7-1ed1-41c2-87b2-de86d3079b80.png" alt="The Sound Of Colleagues" border="0"></a></figure>

<p><em>The Sound of Colleagues</em> lets you mix office noises to create your custom office ambient noise. People typing and talking, phones ringing, the coffee machine, the printer &mdash; all of these little things add up to bring a bit of office feeling to your home. Maybe it’ll even help you boost your productivity, who knows?</p>

### A Minimalist And Modern Media Player Library

<p>If you want to embed a media player on your site, <a href="https://vime-js.com/">Vime</a> might be worth taking a closer look at. Built around the idea that you control the player, not the other way around, the open-source library provides an alternative to Videojs and Plyr and supports HTML5, HLS, Dash, YouTube, Vimeo, and Dailymotion.</p>

<figure><a title="Vime" href="https://vime-js.com/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://mcusercontent.com/16b832d9ad4b28edf261f34df/images/d6c99b0d-09ff-4a07-aa5e-73beffcdff2a.png" alt="Vime" border="0"></a></figure>

<p>Vime does not only shine with a minimalist, sleek look, but it is responsive, accessible, modular, and lightweight, too. It gets by without any external dependencies and comes in different packages tailored to different needs so that you can pick just what’s required for your use case. And since minimalist doesn’t mean bland, Vime is backed up by a plugin system that offers a lot of room for customization &mdash; think custom controls, settings, tooltips, and more. The last two versions of all modern browsers as well as IE11 are supported. </p>
