  hope you'll be on vacation for the upcoming days or can relax a bit from your
  daily work. Remind to take care of yourself, and see you next year!

  New year's resolutions — you know it, they're hard to reach. Find out why it's

## Web Performance

*   Vitaly Friedman put together a great [Front-End Performance Checklist 2017](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/12/front-end-performance-checklist-2017-pdf-pages/) for your next projects, with PDF and Apple Pages files so you can tick it off point by point.

## Going Beyond…

*   We like to say "2016 was the worst", and I don't like this. Angus Hervey shares [99 good news stories that we probably didn't hear about in 2016](https://medium.com/@angushervey/99-reasons-why-2016-has-been-a-great-year-for-humanity-8420debc2823). Don't let you be fooled by the all negative news and instead embrace the good things that happened as well. Despite some bad news, 2016 was quite a good year. Enjoy its last days!
*   The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) published a [first draft guide for how tech can achieve ethical Artificial Intelligence (AI) design](https://techcrunch.com/2016/12/13/ieee-puts-out-a-first-draft-guide-for-how-tech-can-achieve-ethical-ai-design/).

_And with that, I'll close for this week. If you like what I write each week, please [support me with a donation](https://wdrl.info/donate) or share this resource with other people. You can learn more [about the costs of the project here](https://wdrl.info/costs/). It's available via email, RSS and online._
