  Over the last years we've got a pretty good understanding of what CSS does, how it works and how we can use it for our layouts, typography and visual presentation of the content. However, there are still some attributes that are not so well-known; also, CSS3 offers us new possibilities and tools that need to be understood, learned and then applied in the right context to the right effect.

In this round-up we present fresh useful articles about less-known CSS 2.1 and CSS3 properties as well as an overview of <strong>recently published CSS techniques, tools and tips</strong> for designers and web-developers. Please stay tuned: next week we will present the second part of this article, featuring fresh CSS3 techniques, tools and resources.

## Learn About Obscure CSS Properties

<a href="https://webdesignernotebook.com/css/the-little-known-font-size-adjust-css3-property/">The Little Known font-size-adjust Property</a>
Ever wanted to use fallback fonts on your CSS with different aspect ratios without them looking huge (or tiny)? The sparkling new CSS3 <code>font-size-adjust</code> property could do just that.

Demystifying CSS At-Rules
CSS at-rules (or @rules) are so-named because they utilize the '@'-character. They aren't used as often as other CSS elements, and so it may be easy to overlook their function. If you've ever been confused about CSS at-rules, here's a quick guide.

<a href="https://www.impressivewebs.com/css-white-space/">The CSS white-space Property Explained</a>
CSS has a pretty useful property called <code>white-space</code> that often goes unnoticed among CSS beginners. You can probably live without this property for quite some time, but once you learn how to use it, it will come in very handy and you’ll find yourself going back to it over and over again.

<a href="https://css-tricks.com/how-nth-child-works/">How nth-child Works </a><br>
<code>nth-child</code> is one of those rather unfortunate CSS attributes that is caught between nearly full cross-browser compatibility, except for completely zero support in IE, even IE 8. By Chris Coyier.

<a href="https://webdesignernotebook.com/css/the-css3-target-pseudo-class-and-css-animations/">The CSS3 :target Pseudo-class And CSS Animations</a>
There are so many underused techniques that we could be applying to our designs as an enhancement layer. Let's take a brief look into the <code>:target</code> pseudo-class and a very simple CSS animation.

<a href="https://www.onderhond.com/blog/work/the-space-combinator">The space combinator </a>
Combinators are an overlooked part of CSS development. Most juniors don't even know they are making use of them, others are unaware of their full potential and let's face it, even most professionals don't really know about the ins and outs of css combinators. It's all connected to that little piece of nothingness in between class names, so let's start by taking a good look at the space (descendant) combinator.

[![The space combinator ](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/88c1c807-e03b-4127-b65c-992b54de08d8/css3-216.jpg)](https://www.onderhond.com/blog/work/the-space-combinator)

<a href="https://blog.mozilla.com/webdev/2009/02/20/cross-browser-inline-block/">Cross-Browser Inline-Block </a>
Ah, inline-block, that elusive and oh so tempting display declaration that promises so much, yet delivers so little. An article explaining what inline-block is, how it works and what it is good for.

<a href="https://css-tricks.com/attribute-selectors/">The Skinny on CSS Attribute Selectors </a>
Single element has three attributes: ID, class, and rel. To select the element in CSS, you could use and ID selector (#first-title) or a class selector (.magical). But did you know you can select it based on that rel attribute as well? That is what is known as an attribute selector.

[![The Skinny on CSS Attribute Selectors ](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/75bf5379-230a-4151-a1d8-6534b216f692/css3-10.jpg)](https://css-tricks.com/attribute-selectors/)

<a href="https://webtint.net/tutorials/the-mysterious-pseudo-class-in-css/">The Mysterious Pseudo Class in CSS</a>
Pseudo classes let you control the CSS of stuff in different forms, states and places easily and efficiently, without taking up too much room. CSS3 is going to introduce many new pseudo classes, and they're going to make our lives a lot easier (if you take browser compatibility out of the equation). They help both aesthetics and usability, and can make things that were once hard easier than ever before.

<a href="https://www.impressivewebs.com/css-opacity-reference/">CSS Opacity: A Comprehensive Reference</a>
This reference is going to provide a detailed overview of CSS opacity, along with some code examples and explanations to help you implement this useful CSS technique in your projects equally across all browsers. One thing that should be noted about CSS opacity is that, although it's been in use for a number of years now, it has never been, and is currently not a standard property. It's a non-standard technique that is supposed to be part of the CSS3 specification.

<a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/08/17/taming-advanced-css-selectors/">Taming Advanced CSS Selectors </a>
The best way to avoid plagues spreading in your markup and keep it clean and semantic, is by using more complex CSS selectors, ones that can target specific elements without the need of a class or an id, and by doing that keep our code and our stylesheets flexible.

A Look at Some of the New Selectors Introduced in CSS3
Here is a run-down of just some of the things that is possible with CSS3 selectors. Of course, CSS3 isn't supported at all by any IE browsers including IE8; but all latest versions of Safari, Firefox and Opera support most, if not all of them.</p>

## Useful CSS Techniques

<a href="https://zomigi.com/blog/deal-breaker-problems-with-css3-multi-columns/"> Deal-breaker problems with CSS3 multi-columns</a>
"I've been playing around with the new multi-column properties of CSS3 (column-count, column-width, and so forth), and I've come to the conclusion that they're sadly not ready to really use. I found that there's not enough control over how the content is distributed between columns to make them reliable. I'm not sure if the browser behavior I've been seeing is correct or not; the spec is unfortunately not well defined enough to make it clear—at least to me—of how browsers ought to be handling some of the problems I ran across."

Correcting Orphans with Overflow
"The <code>overflow</code> property in CSS can be used in various ways and comes in handy when correcting bugs. Below are some tutorials that demonstrate how to clear up some common issues using the overflow property."

![No orphans](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/5b45caee-257c-44bf-a57c-3b67e1971bca/css3-25.jpg)

CSS Sprites without Using Background Images
" The first approach in my mind was to do the typical CSS Sprites but this requires CSS work which my client did not know much of. I wanted to give him the access to update his affiliate banners using WordPress, and the simplest thing was to let him just upload his own images and put the URL in a custom field. No CSS tweaks involved, just what he needed."

<a href="https://www.impressivewebs.com/center-multiple-divs/">Center Multiple DIVs with CSS</a>
At some point, you may have a situation where you want to center multiple elements (maybe &lt;div&gt; elements, or other block elements) on a single line in a fixed-width area. Centering a single element in a fixed area is easy. Just add margin: auto and a fixed width to the element you want to center, and the margins will force the element to center.

<a href="https://css-tricks.com/resolution-specific-stylesheets/">Different Stylesheets for Differently Sized Browser Windows</a>
Otherwise known as “resolution dependent layouts”. Single website, different CSS files for rearranging a website to take advantage of the size available. There is a W3C standard way of declaring them.

<a href="https://perishablepress.com/press/2009/12/06/new-clearfix-hack/">The New Clearfix Method</a>
The clearfix hack, or “easy-clearing” hack, is a useful method of clearing floats. The original clearfix hack works great, but the browsers that it targets are either obsolete or well on their way.

<a href="https://perishablepress.com/press/2009/12/28/3-ways-preload-images-css-javascript-ajax/">Preload Images with CSS, JavaScript, or Ajax</a>
"Preloading images definitely helps users without broadband enjoy a better experience when viewing your content. In this article, we’ll explore three different preloading techniques to enhance the performance and usability of your site."

<a href="https://www.impressivewebs.com/buggy-css-selectors-cross-browser-jquery/">Getting Buggy CSS Selectors to Work Cross-Browser via jQuery</a>
Although the lack of cross-browser CSS selector support has caused a number of useful CSS selectors to go almost unnoticed, developers can still manipulate styles on their pages using some of these little-used selectors through jQuery.

Reorganize visited links with CSS3 flexible box model
An interesting technique that uses flexible box model (box, box-flex, box-ordinal-group), generated content (:before, :after) and :not and :first-of-type selectors to reorganize visited links on the page.

<span class="removed_link" title="https://haslayout.net/css-tuts/Vertical-Centering">Vertical Centering </span>
Vertical centering with CSS seems to be a large obsticle in the Web design world and I notice a lot of people favor &lt;table&gt;-based layouts when the need for vertical center arises. That's too bad. Whilst CSS vertical center can get [very] complicated at times, I believe that learning various techniques for archiving it is beneficial and once you get a hang of it, you'll do it just as anything else with CSS.

<a href="https://fantasai.inkedblade.net/style/discuss/vertical-text/">Robust Vertical Text Layout</a>
Few formatting systems today can handle vertical text layout, and most of those only lay out text in right-to-left columns. This document outlines a system that can not only handle common scripts in vertical right-to-left columns, but that can gracefully accept uncommon script combinations and left-to-right text columns. The model is described here as a CSS system, but the concepts can apply to non-CSS systems as well.

<a href="https://www.cloudfour.com/ipad-css/">iPad Orientation CSS</a>
For the most part, Mobile Safari on the iPad is the same as that on the iPhone. One difference is that Webkit on the iPad honors CSS media query declarations based on orientation.

<a href="https://matthewjamestaylor.com/blog/keeping-footers-at-the-bottom-of-the-page"> How to keep footers at the bottom of the page</a>
When an HTML page contains a small amount of content, the footer can sometimes sit halfway up the page leaving a blank space underneath. This can look bad, particularly on a large screen. Web designers are often asked to push footers down to the bottom of the viewport, but it's not immediately obvious how this can be done.

Sexy CSS Buttons
CSS is getting quite powerful these days. It can even take the place of images in many ways, giving you a more flexible design and fewer files to work with. Imagine being able to make an ultra sexy button with just CSS, giving you complete control through code. Well, you can! And it's not too difficult, really.

While they may not be used as often as they once were in the heyday of table based web design, image maps can still be quite useful in situations that call for it. Unfortunately, for beginners, achieving this with CSS alone, can be a difficult concept to grasp. In this tutorial, we're not only going to get you up to speed on how to create a CSS image map, but, we're also going to take it a couple steps further and add hover states to our image map using a CSS background image sprite, as well as a "tooltip" like popup.

"I figured that it would be a good idea to show the content of a footnote as soon as you indicate that you are interested in the footnote. Namely, when you move the cursor over the footnote symbol. This allows footnotes to work on devices that don't support mouse hovering, because you can still jump to a footnote via its link, but it removes the necessity of having to click on a footnote link for most people."

## Useful CSS Tools, Tips and Advice

CSS deployment: combine CSS files into a master file
A handy PHP script which reads a directory with css files and combines them automatically into one master stylesheet. No matter how many files you add while developing, before launch you can use a build script that merges them all so you can save HTTP requests.

The way most people link CSS intended for different media types, such as screen, print, or handheld, is to use multiple files. The files are then linked either through link elements with a media attribute or through @import statements with one or more media types specified.

<a href="https://css-tricks.com/efficiently-rendering-css/">Efficiently Rendering CSS </a>
How efficient is the CSS that we write, in terms of how quickly the browser can render it? This is definitely something that browser vendors care about (the faster pages load the happier people are using their products). Let's cover some of the big ideas they present, and then discuss the practicalities of it all.

<a href="https://glazman.org/JSCSSP/">JSCSSP, a CSS parser in JavaScript</a>
JSCSSP is a CSS parser written in cross-browser JavaScript. It parses a string containing CSS styles and outputs a CSS Object Model (warning: not the CSS Object Model). It can preserve some comments, at-rules and style rules that your browser does not recognize and trashes, and even whitespaces if you absolutely need to preserve indentation and blank lines. It's very simple to use and manipulate, and can be used to write a CSS validator, filters or even CSS extensions for a given browser.
