<a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/27753367/Butler-FREE-FONT">Butler</a> is a serif typeface inspired by a mix between Dala Floda and the Bodoni family. The idea behind it was to bring a bit of modernism to serif fonts by working on the curves of the classical serif fonts and adding an extra stencil family. The result is a font family of 334 characters, seven regular weights and seven stencil weights, text figures, ligatures, fractions, and more. A variety of glyphs make it a good fit for many different languages. Butler works best for posters, very big titles and books. Free for personal and commercial use.</p>

## Legion Slab

<a href="https://luc.devroye.org/fonts-58610.html">Legion Slab</a> is a condensed slab-serif typeface designed by Phil Pham.

However, Legion Slab could be a great fit for headings and product designs. In TrueType format; only a regular weight is available.
