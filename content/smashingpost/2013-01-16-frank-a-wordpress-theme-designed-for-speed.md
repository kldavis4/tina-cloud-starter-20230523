  Frank is a responsive WordPress theme. It uses a modified version of the Foundation](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/04/creating-web-app-in-foundation-for-apps/) grid system. It also offers the unique feature of a modular home page layout system. The theme comes with
  various different layouts for your home page (1 column, 2 column, 3 column, 4 column, etc.) that can be mixed and matched. This allows for a home page with
  different content sections in different layouts.

Today we are pleased to release Frank, an open-source WordPress theme designed and built to provide a light, responsive and unobtrusive reading experience. The theme's default home page makes 9 database queries and consists of 2 requests weighing at roughly 30KB (9.5KB gzipped). Frank keeps it basic: no Javascript dependence, no unnecessary images, just a simple, no-frills, fast blog theme. —Ed.

<p>With intense use of HTML5 and CSS3 Frank cuts down on complexity and improves performance. Frank works <em>decently</em> on Internet Explorer 8+. However, at the moment no guarantees are given for any earlier IE versions. It is packaged with the parent theme (in the <code>frank</code> directory) as well as the child theme (in the <code>somerandomdude</code> directory) which I use for <a href="https://somerandomdude.com">my own site</a>. By using Frank, my home page weighs in at 43.65KB over 6 requests (Google Analytics accounts for ~15.5KB and 3 requests). In addition, 33.78% of global page loads completely within 1 second or less (55.75% in the US). On <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights#url=http_3A_2F_2Fsomerandomdude.com_2F&amp;mobile=false">Google Page Speed</a>, the <a href="https://somerandomdude.com">demo</a> gets an overall PageSpeed Score of 97 (out of 100).</p>

Also, Frank uses a subset of <em>Foundation</em> to provide a responsive layout for desktops, tablets and phones. Add this to the theme's small footprint and you have a mobile-optimized blog. The theme is 100% open source and developer-friendly. The parent theme (<code>/frank</code>) is released under the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU Public License</a> and the child theme (<code>/somerandomdude</code>) directory is released under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License</a>.</p>

## Why Did I Make Frank?

There are three reasons:

The first reason was to make good on a promise. I made the commitment that everything I created on my site would be open source. That is how <a href="https://somerandomdude.com/work/iconic">Iconic</a> was born, and this is how Frank came to be. My site is now 100% open source.

The second reason is that I believe that speed is an essential part of user experience. I wanted my site to reflect that belief.

The last reason is that WordPress has an unfair reputation of being a slow, resource-hungry blogging platform. Make no mistake, WordPress <em>can</em> be slow, but that is often due to poor use. I wanted to make a WordPress theme to break the unfair stereotype.

Frank shines for sites that need a no-frills blog that focuses on the reading experience. Frank is not for everybody, but it shines when used in its sweet spot.

## Future Development

Frank is ready to be used, but there is still a <em>long way</em> to go until it's in tip-top shape. This theme can and will get faster. Here’s what is currently being worked on.

*   Greater typographic and visual polish
*   Increased CSS optimization
*   HTML cleanups and structural improvements
*   Modernization and optimization of Javascript components
*   Improved organization and structure of SCSS files
*   Developer-friendly build tools
*   Guides for optimal use of Frank
