*   **Advanced Front-End Techniques**  
    _(e.g. CSS/JS architecture, Sass, LESS, maintanence)_
*   **Performance Optimization**  
    _(e.g. refactoring, optimization for mobile)_
*   **User Experience**  
    _(e.g. mobile UX, design patterns, usability testing)_
*   **Conversion Rate Optimization**  
    _(e.g. checkout process, Web forms)_
*   **Building and Debugging Web Apps**  
    _(e.g. tools, strategy, maintenance issues)_
