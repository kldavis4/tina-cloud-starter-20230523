Nearly half a year ago, we introduced our eBook subscription model, also known as the [Smashing Library](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/ebook-bundles/smashing-library/). We knew we were onto something good, realizing that the Smashing Library was the next step in offering quality content — at a price you’ll still be able to afford all of the coffee you need to stay up long enough to read the entire library and, of course, the free eBooks.

[![The Smashing Library Subscription](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/daecec49-7faf-432d-997b-06a271772a23 ashing-library-logo1.png)](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/ebook-bundles/smashing-library/) 

And our library is getting <em>even more</em> smashing. We didn’t want to limit the library to just our own content, so we are now including a growing number of industry-related eBooks. These books are by authors who aren’t necessarily affiliated with Smashing Magazine but who produce great content. In addition to <strong>saving more than half off the regular bundle prices</strong>, as a subscriber to the Smashing Library, you will get the opportunity to vote on what we publish next and what new eBook downloads will be automatically available in your Smashing Shop dashboard.

### What Subscribers Think of the Smashing Library

Coming up with the subscription library model took meticulous planning and careful editorial work. Adding eBooks on a monthly basis and keeping up with industry trends take passion. Luckily, we have a lot of that. From the beginning, we had a feeling that the library would be popular, and with the surprisingly positive launch, you proved us right:
<blockquote>"A perfect resource for a full-service Web-dev company. I own and operate a Web development company. This <strong>provides a vast store of wisdom</strong> for daily operations across the board."
– <em>Taylor Black</em></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Unbelievable bargain! <strong>This is indeed a great offer</strong> if you're thinking about purchasing several books and if you want to keep up with current developments. Very curious about what’s yet to come this year!"
– <em>Joachim</em></blockquote>

<blockquote>"<strong>The best magazine is up with the best books</strong>. I recently received “The Mobile Book.” That was awesome, and I hope this will be 38X awesome. Worth reading!"
– <em>Erik Royall</em></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Great books, nice offer! I already own Smashing Book #3 and was thinking about buying the mobile/coding bundle when I stumbled upon this offer. <strong>Been reading (almost) nonstop ever since</strong>, loving it so far! Thanks, Smashing!"
– <em>Bernd</em></blockquote>

We try to make the Smashing Library worthwhile by adding new content regularly and by giving you, the subscriber, the choice of what we publish next. All downloads, eBook polls and news are accessible through your personal Smashing Shop dashboard. Have a look at what the library looks like when you’re logged in:
