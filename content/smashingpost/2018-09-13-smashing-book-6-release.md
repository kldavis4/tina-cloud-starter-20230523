<p>Imagine you were living in a <strong>perfect world</strong>. A world where everybody has fast, stable and unthrottled connections, reliable and powerful devices, exquisite screens, and capable, resilient browsers. The screens are diverse in size and pixel density, yet our interfaces adapt to varying conditions swiftly and seamlessly. What a <strong>glorious time</strong> for all of us — designers, developers, senior Webpack configurators and everybody in-between — to be alive, wouldn’t you agree?</p>

<p>Well, we all know that the reality is slightly more nuanced and complicated than that. That’s why we created <em>Smashing Book 6</em>, our shiny new book that explores uncharted territories and seeks to discover <strong>new reliable front-end and UX techniques</strong>. And now, after 10 months of work, the book is ready, and it's shipping.

## About The Book

<p>Finding your way through front-end and UX these days is challenging and time-consuming. But frankly, we all just don’t have time to afford betting on a wrong strategy. <em>Smashing Book 6</em> sheds some light on <strong>new challenges and opportunities</strong>, but also uncovers new traps and pitfalls in this brave new front-end  world of ours.</p>

<p>Our books <strong>aren't concerned with short-living trends</strong>, and our new book isn't an exception. <em>Smashing Book 6</em> is focused on real challenges and real front-end solutions in the real world: from <strong>accessible apps</strong> to performance to CSS Grid Layout to advanced service workers to responsive <strong>art direction</strong>. No chit-chat or theory. Things that worked, in actual projects. <a href="#toc">Jump to table of contents.</a></p>

<p>In the book, Laura and Marcy explore strategies for <strong>maintainable design systems</strong> and <strong>accessible single-page apps</strong> with React, Angular etc. Mike, Rachel and Lyza share insights on using CSS Custom Properties and CSS Grid in production today. Yoav and Lyza take a dive deep into performance patterns and service workers in times of <strong>Progressive Web Apps</strong> and HTTP/2.</p>

<p>Ada, Adrian and Greg explore how to <strong>design for watches</strong> and new form factors, as well as AR/VR/XR, chatbots and conversational UIs. The last chapter will guide you through some practical strategies to break out of generic, predictable, and soulless interfaces — with dozens of examples of <strong>responsive art direction</strong>. But most importantly: it’s the book dedicated to headaches and solutions in the fragile, inconsistent, fragmented and wonderfully diverse web we find ourselves in today.</p>

## About The Designer

<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="hidden sm:block sm:float-right p-4 rounded-full max-w-1/2"  src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/bc22306d-4e27-43f2-af67-0dd5ab98662d/chiara-aliotta-round-180px-opt.png" width="240" height="240" alt="Chiara Aliotta" />The cover was designed with love from Italy by one-and-only <a href="https://twitter.com/chiaraaliotta">Chiara Aliotta</a>. She founded the design studio <a href="https://untilsunday.it/">Until Sunday</a> and has directed the overall artistic look and feel of different tech companies and not-for-profit organizations around the world. We’re very happy that she gave <em>Smashing Book 6</em> that special, magical touch.</p>

### Behind The Scenes Of The Design Process

<p>We asked Chiara to share some insights into the design process of the cover and the interior design and she was very kind to share some thoughts with us:</p>

<p>"It all started with a few exchanges of emails and a Skype meeting where Vitaly shared his idea of the book and the general content. I had a lot of freedom, which is always exciting and scary at the same time. The only <em>bond</em> (if we want to call it like this) was that the "S" of Smashing Magazine should be the <strong>main protagonist of the cover</strong>, reinvented and creatively presented as per all the other previous Smashing Books.</p>

{{< rimg breakout="false" href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/53af0a88-61d4-4f67-92f6-1c3501e9cfc5/sm6-sketches-03.jpg" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/53af0a88-61d4-4f67-92f6-1c3501e9cfc5/sm6-sketches-03.jpg" sizes="60vw" caption="The illustration on paper. The cover sketched on paper. Also check the <a href='https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4e443fbe-a5cd-4dac-a161-fe5e7d30448e/sm6-initial-cover-sketch.png'>close-up photo</a>. (<a href=''>Large preview</a>)" alt="" >}}

<p>I worked around few keywords that Vitaly was using to describe the book during our meetings and then developed an idea around classical novels of adventure where the main hero leaves home, encounters great hazards, risks, and then eventually returns wiser and/or richer than he/she was before.</p>

<p>So I thought of Smashing Book 6 as a way to propose this basic and <strong>mythic structure under a new light</strong>: through the articles of this book, the modern web designer will be experiencing true and deep adventures.</p>

<p>I imagined the "S" as an <strong>engine</strong>, the starting point of this experience, from where different worlds were creating and expanding. So the cover was the map of these uncharted territories that the book explores.</p>

<figure class="break-out"><a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/upload/v1536748636/cover-presentation-smashing-book-6-large_yziiym.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/upload/v1536748636/cover-presentation-smashing-book-6-large_yziiym.png" width="800" height="648" alt="Every element on the cover has a particular meaning that constructs the S" /></a><figcaption>Every element on the cover has a particular meaning that constructs the S. <a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/indysigner/image/upload/v1536748636/cover-presentation-smashing-book-6-large_yziiym.png">Large view.</a></figcaption></figure>

<p>I am a person who judges books by its cover and having read some of the chapters and knowing some of the well-established writers, I wanted to honour its content and their work by creating a gorgeous cover and chapter illustrations.</p>

<p>For this edition of Smashing Book, I imagined a <strong>textile cover in deep blue</strong>, where the graphic is printed using a very old technique, the hot gold foil stamping.</p>

<p>Together with <a href="https://www.twitter.com/indysigner">Markus</a>, part of the Smashing Magazine team and responsible for the publishing of all the Smashing Books, we worked closely to choose the final details of the binding and guarantee an elegant and sophisticated result, adding a touch of glam to the book.</p>

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7ef20552-1457-40f2-a813-cdc79ac360ae/smb6-front-cover-unpacked.jpg" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7ef20552-1457-40f2-a813-cdc79ac360ae/smb6-front-cover-unpacked.jpg" caption="Smashing Book 6 comes wrapped with a little bookmark. Photo by our dear friend <a href='https://www.twitter.com/marcthiele'>Marc Thiele</a>." sizes="60vw" alt="" >}}

<p>As a final touch, I added a paper wrap around the book that invites the readers to "unlock their adventure",  suggesting a physical action: the reader needs to <strong>tear off the paper</strong> before starting reading the book.
And for this only version, we introduced a customise Smashing Magazine bookmark, also in printed on gold paper. Few more reasons to prefer the paperback version over the digital ones!"</p>

<p>A <strong>huge round of applause</strong> to Chiara for her wonderful work and sharing the thoughts with us. We were remarkably happy with everything from design to content. But what did readers think? Well, I’m glad that you asked!</p>
