## Packaging Design

### Atypyk!

Atypyk is an artistic group of French creative minds. Their products are smart yet ironic, and their ideas are packed into good packaging examples. The second picture is the packaging of a 6pack-vase (cans not included).

### Pot Of

biz-R has recently completed a naming, brand direction and packaging project for Clive’s new ‘Potof’ range of fresh organic meals. a really bold, highly graphic, identity based on symbology,pattern and colour associated with each recipe’s origin. The eye-catching result communicates beautifully, on and off the shelf.

### 100% Chocolate Cafe

The concept behind Tokyo's 100% Chocolate Cafe is to put your senses in the middle of a chocolate kitchen. They live up to their name with over 56 types of different chocolates, cheese and black pepper chocolates. They also serve chocolate drinks, chocolate pastries, chocolate ice cream, and even chocolate sandwiches. Colorful and clean packaging.

### Tasty Type

Izze Beverage Co®. doesn't boast their nonprofit mission on their label, but the design’s simplicity hints that they are a different kind of company. Izze’s sales grew 450% per year over the first two years without any TV, print, or online advertising. Surely their success is due in part to the bottle — clearly branded with Trade Gothic™ caps and a clever use of a Caslon™ asterisk, emulating a cross-section of the fruit contained therein.

### Arcadia Organic Tea

This packaging was hand made and assembled by me for a package design class as part of my BFA. The pattern was lacquer transfered to green paper. They come in a package of four so placed back-to-back all the little pyramids would nest together to make a larger pyramid.

"Our brief was to create a compelling and inspirational solution. Because of copyright issues regarding artist’s work was a problem, our solution was to take inspiration from the though process behind how one paints and draws and to convey famous artists thoughts by choosing relevant quotes that captured the spirit of the product. We achieved this by commissioning different illustrators to recreate these quotes with the relevant use of materials."
