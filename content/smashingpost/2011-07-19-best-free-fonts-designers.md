  I've been meaning to write this post but just haven't had the time to do so.
  I've received several messages and emails asking me about fonts that I use on
  some of my design projects. I have a pretty large font collection. Some of
  them are paid, but a lot of them are free! First of all, I suggest investing
  in some of the best
  [typefaces](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/02/a-critical-approach-to-typefaces/)
  out there but I also suggest that you take advantage of the free resources

Anyway, I just want to share with you some of my favorite websites to obtain some high-quality typefaces that you can immediately start using on your projects. By the way, a lot of the free fonts on these sites can also be used for @font-face implementation as well.</p>

{{% feature-panel %}}

1.  [**The League of Moveable Type**](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/ "The League of Moveable Type") This website has a great collection of free fonts including League Gothic, which has really become popular. I would suggest following them on Twitter or subscribing to their feed as well.
2.  [**Lost Type**](https://www.losttype.com/browse/ "Lost Type") I just recently stumbled upon this website and they have lots of great fonts that are available for download. Although the fonts are free, I'm sure they would love your support so maybe donate a few dollars to them.
3.  [**Font Squirrel**](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/ "Font Squirrel") This is a great website with tons of high-quality fonts that are mostly @font-face compatible. You can also download their fonts as @font-face kits and they also have a @font-face generator. This is definitely a great resource.
4.  [**FontFabric**](https://fontfabric.com/category/free/ "FontFabric") They have a great freebie section with lots of nice fonts to download.
5.  [**DaFont**](https://www.dafont.com/ "DaFont") There are a lot of fonts on this site. Sure, not all of them are the best quality, but I usually go to this site if I'm looking for a font to use with a particular look or theme. For example, if I wanted to use an Indiana Jones font or some other type of movie font, I would just do a search on this site.</p>

## [Anivers Regular](https://exljbris.com/anivers.html)

Jos Buivenga has released an update for Anivers, a font which was originally designed to celebrate the first anniversary of Smashing Magazine. Now the new improved Anivers has been expanded and Anivers Regular undergone a major update. Changes: extended language support, improved glyph shapes and improved metrics and kerning.

Jos Buivenga has extended Anivers to the Anivers family which now comes in regular, italic, bold and small caps and has some nice OpenType features. However, <strong>only Anivers regular is free</strong>. To download the free Regular you have to register at MyFonts.com. The rest of the family can be purchased on MyFonts.</p>

## [Fertigo Pro](https://exljbris.com/fertigo.html)

Jos Buivenga has updated the old freefont Fertigo and has now called it Fertigo Pro. Fertigo Pro is still free. Important changes are extended language support (more than 150 glyphs added), improved glyph shapes, 10 added ornaments/dingbats and improved metrics and kerning. Languages now (fully) supported: Latin, Central European, Croatian, Romanian, Icelandic, Turkish, Esperanto.</p>

## [Gentium](https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=Gentium) ([specimen](https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=Gentium_samples)) and [Gentium Basic](https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=Gentium_basic)

SIL International which has released Gentium few years ago, now released a modification of Gentium which is called Gentium Basic. Gentium is a typeface family designed to enable the diverse ethnic groups around the world who use the Latin and Greek scripts to produce readable, high-quality publications. It supports a wide range of Latin-based alphabets and includes glyphs that correspond to all the Latin ranges of Unicode.

<strong>Gentium Basic</strong> and Gentium Book Basic are font families based on the original Gentium design, but with additional weights. The "Book" family is slightly heavier. Both families come with a complete regular, bold, italic and bold italic set of fonts. The supported character set, however, is much smaller than for the main Gentium fonts. These "Basic" fonts support only the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement Unicode ranges, plus a selection of the more commonly used extended Latin characters, with miscellaneous diacritical marks, symbols and punctuation. Designed by Victor Gaultney.
