  These are great times for front-end developers. After months of [exaggerated
  excitement](https://matthewjamestaylor.com/blog/css3-starbursts) about HTML5
  and CSS3, the web design community now starts coming up with CSS techniques
  that actually put newly available technologies to practical use instead of
  [abusing them for pure aesthetic
  purposes](https://farukat.es/journal/2010/08/469-pure-css-icons-make-madness-stop).
  We see fewer "pure CSS images" and more advanced, clever CSS techniques that
  can actually improve the Web browsing experience of users. And that's a good
  thing!

  In this post we present **recently released CSS techniques, tutorials and
  tools** for you to use and enhance your workflow, thus improving your skills.
  Please don't hesitate to comment on this post and let us know how exactly you
  are using them in your workflow. However, please avoid link dropping, but
  share your insights and your experience instead. Also, notice that some
  techniques are not only CSS-based, but use JavaScript, or JavaScript-libraries
  as well.

## CSS Techniques

<a href="https://maxvoltar.com/temp/nowplaying/">Now Playing: transitions and animations with CSS</a>
Tim Van Damme showcases a fairly simple CSS design that uses transitions, animations and subtle hover-effects to produce an engaging user experience. Also, notice the use of favicons as background-images for attribute selectors. Unfortunately, the demo works best in Webkit-browsers, but it degrades gracefully in other modern browsers. Unfortunately, we didn't find the documentation of the technique.

CSS3 range slider, checkbox + radio button
A demo of HTML input elements made with CSS3. They include realistic range sliders, checkboxes and radio buttons. The designer used minimal markup, no JavaScript and no images. Downside: there is a ton of messy CSS3 code, and Safari renders the page best. Chrome is close, but the 3D perspective doesn't quite work.

![umbrUI - CSS3 range slider, checkbox + radio button](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/9349a0da-d41e-46d0-8813-ded9d1a0399d/css-technique-409.jpg)

<a href="https://www.webdesignerwall.com/tutorials/css3-media-queries/">CSS3 Media Queries</a>
CSS2 allows you to specify stylesheet for specific media type such as screen or print. Now CSS3 makes it even more efficient by adding media queries. You can add expressions to media type to check for certain conditions and apply different stylesheets. For example, you can have one stylesheet for large displays and a different stylesheet specifically for mobile devices. It is quite powerful because it allows you to tailor to different resolutions and devices without changing the content. Continue on this post to read the tutorial and see some websites that make good use of media queries.

<a href="https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/proportional_leading_with_css3_media_queries/">Proportional leading with CSS3 Media Queries</a>
A fluid layout should be responsive to the width of the columns of text. This problem, of proportional leading, is what holds many designers back from adopting fluid layouts. In this article, Andy Clarke explains how you can achieve proportional leading for your typography using CSS3 Media Queries.

Popout Details on Hover with CSS
This tutorial describes a technique that presents details of a content item on hover. The solution is quite simple and uses <code>position: relative</code> and <code>z-index</code> to achieve the effect.

<a href="https://trentwalton.com/2010/08/03/css3-border-radius-rounded-avatars/">CSS3 Border-Radius and Rounded Avatars</a>
Trent Walton came up with a clever technique to create rounded images (in this case, rounded avatars) with the <code>border-radius</code> property. The solution is simple: create a frame class for your image, and give it a border. Then, round both the frame and image with the <code>border-radius</code> property, and you’re done: a simple technique with no additional images or scripts — just an extra line of code. You may want to check <a href="https://maxvoltar.com/archive/rounded-corners-on-images-css-only">Tim Van Damme's similar CSS technique</a>, too.

<a href="https://www.webdesignerwall.com/tutorials/css3-rounded-image-with-jquery/">CSS3 Rounded Image With jQuery</a>
"The other day I was trying to style CSS3 border-radius to image element and I realized that Firefox doesn’t display <code>border-radius</code> on images. Then I figured a way to work around it — wrap a <code>span</code> tag around with the original image as a <code>background-image</code>."

<a href="https://www.webdesignerwall.com/tutorials/the-simpler-css-grid/">The Simpler CSS Grid</a>
Why restrict your layout so that it can fit into this 960gs? A grid is supposed to help you in design, not to limit your creativity. The 978 grid is not just about increasing the page width, but to loosen the gutter space, so users can read it more comfortably.

Correcting Orphans with CSS Overflow
When typesetting, designers try to avoid leaving just one or a few words hanging on a line at the end of a paragraph. Doing so is considered poor typography because it leaves too much white space between paragraphs and interrupts the reader’s eye movement (see the example below). A simple typographic solution is to rework the line by adding indented paragraph endings. But the problem is particularly annoying when aligning a paragraph next to an image that exceeds the paragraph's height. Soh Tanaka has come up with a simple and quick solution to this problem with CSS.

<a href="https://nicolasgallagher.com/css-pseudo-element-solar-system/">CSS pseudo-element Solar System using semantic HTML</a>
This is a complete reworking of another author’s basic reproduction of the classic model of our solar system using CSS. By using pseudo-elements (again) I wanted to reproduce as much as possible without presentational HTML and JavaScript. In addition, by hooking into HTML microdata I’ve put together a rough scale model of the solar system that demonstrates some further uses of CSS generated content.

Advanced Columns using the :nth-child(N)
Imagine this task: you have to display product listings as columns laid out in a zig zag pattern. The first instinct is to split each section into its own list, but if the site is running on a CMS, all products had to be spit out in one giant list. Given this scenario, you can use pseudo-selectors <code>:nth-child(N)</code> and a bit of jQuery to help with IE support.

Simple Tooltip w/ jQuery and CSS
There are a lot of tooltip plugins out there, but not many of them explain what exactly goes on in the logic of a tooltip. I would like to share how I’ve created mine today, and am also open to any critiques and suggestions for those jQuery ninjas out there. Lets take a look.

<a href="https://articles.sitepoint.com/article/css3-border-images">CSS3 Border Images for Beautiful, Flexible Boxes</a>
The CSS3 buzz is in full swing, and many of CSS3's most useful properties are receiving a fair bit of attention.

CSS Border Tricks
Since I released my new redesigned blog, a lot of people have asked me how I styled the pressed effect on my category navigation. I would like to share some simple border style tricks to get various effects for your next project.

<a href="https://www.designmadeingermany.de/blog/der-backgroundtrick/">The Background Trick With CSS</a>
This page provides links to a couple of examples for the trick used on <a href="https://www.designmadeingermany.de/magazin/5/">Design Made In Germany 5</a> where a couple of layers are used and the middle layer has a fixed background, while other layers have absolute positioning. The visual effect is unique and interesting. Unfortunately, the explanations are in German, but the demos are self-explanatory.

<a href="https://ignorethecode.net/blog/2010/04/20/footnotes/">Footnotes With CSS</a>
in their simplest implementation — using <code>sup</code> tags and linking within the page — footnotes aren't very user-friendly. They interrupt the experience, requiring the user to click the link, read the information and then return to the page with the browser's "Back" button." Lukas Mathis has come up with an elegant solution to improve this user experience: his jQuery script shows the content of footnotes as soon as the user indicates that they are interested in it — i.e. when they move the cursor over the footnote symbol.

Although many will argue that Microsoft products are an example of a good design, Minibar was one of design refreshments that came out with the Office 2007. It is a variation of a toolbar that exposes context-related functionality. In case of MS Word, context is a text selection. Since Minibar always pops up near the mouse pointer it enables users to quickly perform actions related to a selection.

I recently came up with an issue in Safari where the background colour of an element seemed to "bleed' through the edge of the corners when applying both borders and a border-radius (see the image above).

Zebra-striping rows and columns
Zebra-striping tables is certainly not a new thing; it has been done and discussed for years. They (allegedly) aid usability in reading tabular data by offering the user a coloured means of separating and differentiating rows from one another. We can create zebra-stripes using the <code>nth-of-type</code> selector — but we can apply it not only to rows but also columns.

HTML5 is coming to modern browsers, and developers are already pushing its limits. To this end, Microsoft has created an online comic to show off HTML5/CSS3’s features (SVG background, JavaScript acceleration, etc.) as they function on IE9. It’s a fully interactive experience, complete with animations and other features that were until now possibly only with JavaScript or Flash.

[![Never Mind the Bullets - BEAUTY OF THE WEB](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/02cf5748-becd-4cc0-9efd-8716779c0134/css-196.jpg)](https://www.nevermindthebullets.com/)

The comic is a Western in a fairly traditional comic-book style, but with a lot of extras. It’s viewable in other browsers, but not as fully as with all of the features built into IE9. There’s also a feature that lets you create your own comic strip using the same characters. We never thought we’d say these words, but the website is actually best viewed in Internet Explorer 9.</p>
