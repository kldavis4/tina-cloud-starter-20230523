  We all have our favorite designers. One of my favorite designers happens to be
  **Michael Heald**, the founder of [Fully
  Illustrated](https://www.fullyillustrated.com/). Michael Heald is an award
  winning graphic and web designer. He has won multiple awards, as well as being
  featured in some top web and graphic design magazines.

  Heald's work is spectacular. The thing that impresses me about his work is the
  variety of different styles that he has mastered. **Not only is he a master of
  illustrations, he is a great web designer as well.** His web designs are
  beautiful. That is why he has had the opportunity to design websites for the
  biggest games out there, including the top iPhone game, **Fieldrunners**.

Heald's work is spectacular. The thing that impresses me about his work is the variety of different styles that he has mastered. <strong>Not only is he a master of illustrations, he is a great web designer as well.</strong> His web designs are beautiful. That is why he has had the opportunity to design websites for the biggest games out there, including the top iPhone game, <strong>Fieldrunners</strong>.
<blockquote>During this time I have serviced the creative needs of some of the biggest global brands, such as Nintendo, Pepsi and MTV. What all this means, is that since setting up Fully Illustrated as a one man creative machine, I can now bring all those skills, years of experience and oodles of passion, in a whole new, and much more affordable package!</blockquote>

## Character Illustrations

Michael Heald's character illustrations are very clean, the lines are crisp and the use of color is perfect. He has created his unique style that you can see throughout his different illustrations.
<blockquote>No other art form, in my opinion, can evoke such an immediate response from the viewer.Â  I love to see a person's face light up upon seeing a new character, its fantastic, and makes every last second of effort worth it.</blockquote>

## Websites

Michael also has some great websites in his portfolio. His websites all look great, no matter what the genre of game he is creating it for. As you will see, <strong>Michael has designed multiple video game websites</strong>, as he is a big-time video game admirer.
<blockquote>I make a valid effort with each and every project to make it better than my last, meaning that I never have and never will rest on my laurels. I will never be satisfied with where I am, and will always yearn to create something better. I believe this is the only mentality to have when you work in design.</blockquote>
