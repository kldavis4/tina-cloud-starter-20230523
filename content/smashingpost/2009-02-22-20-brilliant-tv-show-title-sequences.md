  Since the advent (and in turn, massive success) of "TV on DVD", television
  programming has really upped the ante in production value. Now-a-days it seems
  every show is presented in glorious high definition with big name actors and
  well-structured story telling. But there is another significant improvement in
  television over the last few years that could use some recognition: **the
  title sequence**.

  Long gone are the days of cheesy video montages involving "memorable" moments
  from seasons past, coupled with tacky music you can't get out of your head...
  yes I'm looking at you, _Golden Girls_.

  Today, the credit sequences on television are so visually pleasing that even
  though we possess the technology to skip past them, we don't. They're _that_
  captivating. It is in recognition of these amazing television title sequences
  that we've compiled our favorite **20 Brilliant TV Show Title Sequences**.

## 20 Brilliant TV Show Title Sequences

[Mad Men](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0804503/)  
This is probably my favorite title sequence on television at the moment. Every time I watch it, it leaves me wanting more. It was also hilariously parodied on [the Simpsons](https://youtube.com/watch?v=KcmM7Jh2Y3k).

[The United States of Tara](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1001482/)  
A new show with a beautifully animated title sequence. The pop-up book effect is really well done.

[The IT Crowd](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1001482/)  
Such a fantastic title sequence! The 8-bit style animation no doubt speaks to the shows demographic.

[Fringe](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1119644/)  
It's amazing how captivating a 20 second title sequence can be. This one really draws you in.

[House MD](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0412142/)  
The title sequence for "House M.D." is simply beautiful. The imagery and music work so well together.

[Dexter](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0773262/)  
A dark and clever title sequence that sums up the tone of the show beautifully.

[True Blood](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0844441/)  
A masterfully made title sequence that really throws you into the creepy world the show has created.

[Nip/Tuck](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361217/)  
Love this title sequence! The symbolism used is both brilliant and creepy at the same time.

[Clone High](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0305011/)  
Clone High's title sequence is so well made, it rivals any live action show out there.

[Desperate Housewives](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0410975/)  
Say what you will about the show itself, there's no denying it has a pretty cool title sequence. The animation is great.

[Flight of the Conchords](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0863046/)  
If you've ever seen this show, it's only appropriate for the title sequence to feel like a music video.

[Carniv√†le](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0319969/)  
A brilliantly animated title sequence that brings tarot cards to life.

[The Sopranos](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0141842/)  
Though a fairly simple title sequence, this remains one of my all time favorites.

[Samurai Champloo](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0423731/)  
The colors, imagery and typography all work together beautifully in this title sequence.

[Six Feet Under](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0248654/)  
The title sequence for "Six Feet Under" is beautifully shot and at the same time sets up the tone and premise of the show perfectly.

[Lost](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0411008/)  
For a show like Lost that is so reliant on instant gratification, this minimalist title sequence works perfectly to keep up the momentum.

[Deadwood](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0348914/)  
The title sequence for Deadwood will bring you back to the old west faster than you can say "sarsaparilla".

[Rome](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0814164/)  
A wonderfully animated title sequence. The effect of the wall paintings coming to life is perfectly executed.

[John Adams](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472027/)  
Though bending the rules a little to include a mini-series, we would be remiss to include John Adams' powerful title sequence in this list.

[Big Love](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0421030/)  
For a show about polygamy, a title sequence that is littered with metaphors and symbolism is an absolute must.

[Dead Like Me](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0348913/)  
The title sequence for the "late" Dead Like Me perfectly captured the dark humour of the show.

[The Simpsons](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096697/)  
After 20 years, the Simpsons have fully revamped their famous animated title sequence for their transition into high definition.
