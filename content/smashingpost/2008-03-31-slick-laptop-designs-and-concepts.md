  **Laptop design** doesn't have to be boring. Although often laptops look
  exactly as we expect them to look like, there is a number of design solutions
  and approaches which are completely different — unusual, creative, beautiful
  and damn useful. In fact, over the last years designers came up with a number
  of interesting concepts which have somehow stuck between the prototyping stage
  and the production stage. Nevertheless, much is possible. And this post is
  supposed to prove this point.

<strong>Laptop design</strong> doesn't have to be boring. Although often laptops look exactly as we expect them to look like, there is a number of design solutions and approaches which are completely different — unusual, creative, beautiful and damn useful. In fact, over the last years designers came up with a number of interesting concepts which have somehow stuck between the prototyping stage and the production stage. Nevertheless, much is possible. And this post is supposed to prove this point. 

Below we present <strong>innovative laptop designs and laptop concepts</strong>. Many of the products listed below are prototypes and aren't available yet, and it's unknown whether they'll be released over the next years. However, they give us an idea of what we should expect from laptops over the years to come.

No, that's not a new concept, but it looks incredible. From Apple Powerbook 180 with Mac OS 8 to iBook g3 with OS X 10.4. "This is an actual photo. Every screen is showing exactly whats behind it - relative to the camera, which was on a tripod. The most difficult task was to convince the old powerbook 180 to show a simple jpeg. Netscape Navigator 3 did it."
