### Behind the Design

As always, here are some insights from the designer:
<blockquote>"This set was started out in January 2011, so the whole design process took me nearly a year to finish. Including all the tiny, little, shy transparent PNGs and keys, the set is build out of 145.728 pixels. All icons were made with love in Cologne, Germany.

If you think that some icons are missing in this set, feel free to share your thoughts and ideas in the comments section below, contact me at aroma[at]addictedtocoffee[dot]de or find me via twitter at @mywayhome. Oh and did I mention: I'm always available for exciting freelance projects :)

Stay tuned! You never know  —  there might be a second part of the set coming out quite soon!"</blockquote>

Thank you, Oliver Twardowski. We appreciate your work and your good intentions!
