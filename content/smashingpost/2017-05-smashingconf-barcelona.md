In the brave new responsive web, previously established techniques are getting revised and abandoned. Design workflow changes. **Front-end solutions** adapt. Performance optimizations get refined and creative, holistic design thinking is required more than ever. It isn't easy to keep up with all those changes, and that's where our community conferences come into place.

### About The Conference

In Barcelona, we'll explore new front-end challenges, **UX strategies** and design patterns that you can apply to your work right away. No fluff, no theory: just hands-on, practical and on point — things that worked well in **real-life projects**, with talks and workshops by practitioners from the industry.

<figure class="fwi"><a href="https://smashingconf.com/barcelona-2017/locations"><img class="radius" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/be745061-5d2d-4893-bd2b-856a5b20efb0/palau-de-la-musica-opt.jpg" alt="Palau de la Musica" /></a><figcaption>Just like last year, the SmashingConf flags will be blowing in the breeze from the Palau de la Música Catalana — an architectural jewel of Catalan Modernism.

<strong>Nothing obvious, nothing superficial</strong>: just actionable insights that you can apply to your projects right away. From visual design to front-end, from performance to UX to design systems. Think of it as a little playbook with handy rules of thumb: it doesn't get more practical than this.

We also want to hear your stories and your experiences. We believe in sharing, and **will invite you to speak** at the meet-up before the event. The main conference will take place on **October 17–18**, right at the sunny Mediterranean seaside in the one-of-a-kind _Palau de la Música Catalana_. It's an event that might keep you on your toes for quite some time. _Seriously._

#### First Speakers
