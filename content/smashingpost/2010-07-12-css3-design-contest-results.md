  To get you really excited about CSS3, last month we announced the [CSS3 Design Contest](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/18/css3-design-contest-join-in-and-win-ssd-hard-drive/) and encouraged designers to experiment and get creative with CSS3\. As expected, we have received many creative and original submissions. To choose the winners of the contest, we considered the originality of the technique or approach and its uniqueness. The idea mattered more than the execution.
categories:
  - Coding
  - Layouts
  - CSS3
---
This process has taken a lot of time as it wasn't easy, because we received quite a few creative submissions: however, a decision had to be taken and so we thoroughly went from one competition entry to another. And the decision was made. So today, it's time to announce the winners and present the submissions to the contest.

## First place: CSS3 Charts

CSS3 Charts [ <a href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/3d4bc9b5-eb60-4ed4-8ba9-8203f26a6ef7/index.html">preview</a> | <a href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/9aecd4e5-598b-4b42-b17e-659a34c107e6/css3-charts.zip">download</a> ]
This technique is an example of experimental CSS3 charts, without JavaScript and images in use. We miss cleaner markup and proper markup for tabular data here, but the use of CSS3 selectors is truly impressive: <code>nth-child</code>, <code>:target</code>, transformations, gradients and transitions in use.

Interesting idea for a CSS3 design. The designer's idea was to create a navigation menu: although it's not very user-friendly for regular navigation, it may be interesting for engaging portfolio sites. Gradients and transforms in use.

"I came up with this idea when I was sorting all my movies on my movie-stream-server. It would be so nice to have a web interface that's rolling on a web server on the same machine. But if you dont have a server and just have regular DVD/BR, then you can type where the movie is in the shelf. So, what should we watch today? This theme is best experienced in Safari/Chrome because of some CSS3 effects; but it works also in FF, IE and Opera." Designed by Adis Kurtalic from Sweden.

"I got a bit crazy at this contest. I've been experimenting a bit with CSS3. But when I saw this contest, I though for my self.. hey, let's check this specifications at w3. There got be more to it than just rounded corners (which is great by the way). After using a couple of hours reading. I was stunned..whow! 3D effects, shadows. And I was thinking.. what can be painted can also be made in css3 using squares, circles... I was sitting with an iPAD in my hands reading about CSS3. I put it on the table... and thought; this image I am seeing right now, should be possible to make just with CSS3. The solution is best viewed in Google Chrome."

"This design allows you to place any amount of content in the 'columnified' DIV of the layout, allowing for a site-wide flexible and fully customisable 'book-like' feel. It uses the CSS3 multi-column module for the multi-column layout (and a JavaScript solution for Opera and IE, two browsers that, to date, do not support this module — this solution is a modified version of Cédric Savarese's <a href="https://www.alistapart.com/articles/css3multicolumn/">css3-multi-column.js</a>, and uses a combination of CSS shapes, border-radius, transforms, box-shadows and gradients to create the book appearance.

Page turning is achieved via Javascript (pageturn.js). The different stylesheets are fed to browsers via Javascript as well, so as to detect whether the multi-columns are supported or not (stylesheet.js — basic browser detection only, on the assumption that Opera, Firefox, Safari and Chrome users update their browsers regularly). As no images have been used in this template, total customisation of the appearance is easily achieved (moreover, the CSS is annotated). For a full explanation of how the two-column, multi-page layout works, please visit the following <a href="https://www.arpia.be/2010/02/tutorial-multi-page-multi-column-web-pages/">tutorial</a>."

"Whenever I work on a project for myself, I like to try and learn something new. This contest gave me a chance to play with CSS3 without having to worry about clients asking why it works in some browsers and not in others. The main thing I was curious about was the keyframe animations, this was something I had heard about but not played with at all. I am glad that I entered the contest for the sole reason that I learned a lot. I did not realize how easy it was to work with transitions and animations with CSS. This exercise has me really excited about the future. I can't wait to see tomorrows rookie designers using this for spinning swords and dragons that breathe fire."

"It is interleaved video in a jpeg file. Instead of having each frame in its common order, each row is interleaved with the next frames rows. So, the you can see the first row of the first frame, then the first row of the second frame, the first row of the third frame and so on. Jpeg files are size limited, so to be able to have a lot of frames, I've reordered the rows in a 16x16 grid. The top left of the grid is the first row, the next to the right is the second row, the next the third, and in the next colunm we have the n+16th row. This is the code to generate the jpeg file. The frames where named a0001.jpg, a0002.jpg, a0003.jpg...

Then, I'm using the CSS displacement maps I've used in the Coke Can and the other displacement maps I did for Ajaxian. The displacement maps de-interleave the jpeg file. Then, displacing the background-position with CSS3 for each row, I get the video effect. Finally, I added a Smashing Magazine transparent png on top on the video to create the overlay effect. I really like to add video on websites with shapes, it looks really good. I would like to add that this is a crazy way to add video and that it should not be used for any real purpose. When I do things like that is just for pure geek entertainment and to show it is possible. I would suggest for CSS3/HTML5 to have a background-video tag." Designed by Javier Roman from Spain.

"A pure CSS iMac - no images. You can use it to display anything on the screen. In the example I setup a Flickr Feed of images as a slideshow. It is also completely resolution independent. All relative sizes - feel free to scale it up or down by changing your font size. I used some cool techniques including CSS gradients (and Safari Radial Gradients), CSS border-radius, text-shadow, even used a Safari CSS 3D transform for kicks! I used some jQuery to make a slideshow with the Flickr images and image title overlays. Overall, I think it turned out great. I am sure people out there could take this to the next level. It's really easy for anyone to change the flickr feed and put in their own photos if they want. I hope to see this out there somewhere. Exciting! I love CSS3!

"My wish was to create design that shows the full concept, presenting the different capabilities and aspects of CSS3. Probably the design would seem familiar to you and that's it because I used the vision of the template published at your website. I considered that design as extremely appropriate for the case because it's functional and catches the eye of the user. Honestly, I didn't have time to think of my own design but I think that I accomplished my mission to show designers and developers what they can do with little more effort and that's how I even learned some new stuff.

"Totally Fresh is a fun project created not only to display the capabilities of CSS3, but to show an exciting design that pops off the 2-dimensional canvas that is cleanly and properly marked up. I tend to design simple, typographic pieces, but I wanted this design to feel "fresh." The design, therefore, resembles a car air freshener. It reflects a tangible print piece in a 3-dimensional space." Designed by <a href="https://ChrisNager.com">Chris Nager</a> from USA.

I added a fancy arrow to enhance the effect. By giving each page a unique ID in the body tags and each list Item a unique class, when your browser sees the ID for the body, the matching class for the List Item will use the CSS. The fancy Arrow will be used as long as it is in the same directory as the html files. The CSS for the List Item position "Inside" will cause the List Item to move to the right which will visually show the visitor which page they are on. I used this method on the following website, the client was thrilled." Designed by Greg Spence.

I've seen people use CSS3 to create 2D art and thought of doing so myself, yet the idea seemed too easy. However, 3D art using CSS3 is something I have yet to see! I wanted to create an image-less 3D page layout using CSS3\. It took some playing around with the code to find the best method of producing an image-less 3D element, but I'm definitely happy (and excited) with my findings. Although, after the 3D elements were introduced, I felt as through it was still lacking. I needed more, I needed interaction within the 3D space. I then created a 3D navigation bar which acts as buttons. Through CSS3's scaling method I created the illusion of buttons going back within the 3D space on a mouse hover, and on an active state the link creates more of an interactive feel for the user. This is only the beginning of this layout, and I plan to expand upon it to create a fully designed page template which will incorporate more "button-like" interaction throughout the design. Overall, this contest has definitely pushed me to play with CSS3 more and I am truly excited for this to become a web standard!" Designed by [Chris Johnson](https://rebzmedia.com) from USA.

Unfortunately, this entry was submitted too late and couldn't participate in the contest, but it is certainly worth mentioning. Here are the insights from the developer: "After my latest CSS3 experiment without images (Internet Explorer Pure CSS Logo), a friend suggested to create an animated 3D Super Mario Icon based on the 3D Retro Mario GIF image by Cezkid. Well, this is the result of two weeks of work — an animated 3D Super Mario Icon built completely in CSS3 without images."
