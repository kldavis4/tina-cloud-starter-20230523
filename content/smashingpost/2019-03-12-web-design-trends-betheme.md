<p>(This is a sponsored article.) Designers have a strange relationship with trends. On the one hand, when designers follow a crowd, they might feel that they aren’t able to express enough creativity. On the other hand, trends can tell designers a lot about user preferences &mdash; what people love, what they hate &mdash; and ultimately help designers to create products with better adoption rates.</p>

<p>People are visual creatures, and visual design has a significant impact on the way we understand products. In this article, I want to focus on the most crucial web design trends and illustrate each trend using <a href="https://themes.muffingroup.com/be/splash/?utm_source=smashingmagazine.com&utm_medium=content&utm_campaign=march19">Be Theme</a>, a responsive multipurpose WordPress theme.</p>

<p>Let’s get started.</p>

## 1. Digital Illustrations

<p>Digital illustrations have become one of the most important trends in visual design. Relevant illustrations can make your design stand out from a crowd and establish a truly emotional connection with visitors. Illustrations are quite a versatile tool; product designers can use digital illustrations for various purposes: for hero sections, for feature descriptions, or even as a subtle icon in the navigation bar.</p>

<p>Two types of illustrations are popular among digital designers: <strong>hand-drawn flat illustrations</strong> and <strong>three-dimensional ones</strong>. Flat hand-drawn ones give an impression of fine craftsmanship, of a hand-made design; it’s relatively easy to see the personal style of the illustrator through their work. Slack, Intercom and Dropbox are just a few companies that use flat hand-drawn illustrations.</p>

<p>Three-dimensional illustrations are quite a new trend. Designers started using them to add more realism, blurring the boundary between the digital and physical worlds.</p>

## 2. Vibrant Colors

<p>There is a reason why so many digital product designers strive to use vibrant colors: Vibrant colors give visual interest to a layout. User attention is a precious resource, and one of the most effective ways to grab attention is by <strong>using colors that stand out</strong>. Bright colors used for the background can capture the visitor’s attention and contribute to a truly memorable experience.</p>

{{< rimg href="https://bit.ly/bethemeimages" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7813c193-81e9-49aa-84a0-55cf535b0f8c/3-the-latest-web-design-trends-together-with-betheme.png" sizes="100vw" caption="Vivid colors are an excellent way to grab the visitor’s attention.

## 3. Hero Video Headers

<p>“Show, don’t tell” is a foundational principle of good product design. Imagery plays a key role in visual design because it helps the designers to deliver the main idea quickly.</p>

<p>For a long time, web designers have had to use static imagery to convey their main idea. But the situation has changed. High-speed connections make it much easier for web designers to turn their home pages into immersive movie-style experiences. <strong>Video engages users</strong>, and users are more willing to spend time watching clips. Video clips used in a hero section can vary from a few seconds of looped video to full-length preview clips with audio.</p>

## 4. Split Screen

<p>Split screen is a relatively simple design technique. All you need to do to create one is divide the screen into two parts (usually 50/50) and use each part to deliver a distinct message. <strong>This technique translates well on mobile</strong>; two horizontal panels of content can be collapsed into vertical content blocks on small screens. The technique works well when you need to deliver two separate messages, as shown below.</p>

{{< rimg href="https://bit.ly/bethemeimages" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0faf82ec-4e31-428f-a2ec-e84ec8a43394/6-the-latest-web-design-trends-together-with-betheme.png" sizes="100vw" caption="Split screen is an excellent choice for e-commerce websites that offer products for both women and men. (Image source: <a href='https://themes.muffingroup.com/be/couturier/?utm_source=smashingmagazine.com&utm_medium=content&utm_campaign=march19'>themes.muffingroup</a>) (<a href='https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0faf82ec-4e31-428f-a2ec-e84ec8a43394/6-the-latest-web-design-trends-together-with-betheme.png?utm_source=smashingmagazine.com&utm_medium=content&utm_campaign=march19'>Large preview</a>)" alt="Split screen is an excellent choice for e-commerce websites that offer products for both women and men" >}}

<p>It also works well when you have to pair a text message with relevant imagery:</p>

{{< rimg href="https://bit.ly/bethemeimages" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/46362017-bf33-4ac5-b62c-1d2ed08bf204/11-the-latest-web-design-trends-together-with-betheme.png" sizes="100vw" caption="Split screen can be used to connect a text message with relevant imagery. (Image source: <a href='https://themes.muffingroup.com/be/coffee3/?utm_source=smashingmagazine.com&utm_medium=content&utm_campaign=march19'>themes.muffingroup</a>) (<a href='https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/46362017-bf33-4ac5-b62c-1d2ed08bf204/11-the-latest-web-design-trends-together-with-betheme.png?utm_source=smashingmagazine.com&utm_medium=content&utm_campaign=march19'>Large preview</a>)" alt="Split screen can be used to connect a text message with relevant imagery" >}}

## 5. Geometric Patterns

<p>Designers can use geometric shapes and patterns endlessly to create beautiful ornaments. This technique works equally well for digital products. Designers can use SVG images and high-resolution PNGs with geometric patterns as backgrounds. Such backgrounds scale well, so you won’t have to worry about how they will look on small and large displays.</p>

{{< rimg href="https://bit.ly/bethemeimages" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/877ba3e6-a217-4458-9d2d-e3cd7b0145db/7-the-latest-web-design-trends-together-with-betheme.png" sizes="100vw" caption="With geometric patterns, you can let your creativity run wild.

## 6. Gradients and Duotones

<p>Gradients are the multipurpose tool that works in pretty much any type of design. Designers often use gradients to give their work a little more depth. Modern graphic design trends dictate the use of big, bold and colorful gradients, which help designers make a statement.</p>

<p>When it comes to gradients, designers have a lot of creative freedom. They can <strong>experiment with various colors and types</strong>, using radial gradient, linear gradients, etc. For example, this is what happens when you put a linear one-color gradient overlay on a photo:</p>

{{< rimg href="https://bit.ly/bethemeimages" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/1e94a593-dde6-4fde-a661-b667d0c3bd7a/2-the-latest-web-design-trends-together-with-betheme.png" sizes="100vw" caption="One-color gradient overlay on a photo (Image source: <a href='https://themes.muffingroup.com/be/company2/?utm_source=smashingmagazine.com&utm_medium=content&utm_campaign=march19'>themes.muffingroup</a>) (<a href='https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/1e94a593-dde6-4fde-a661-b667d0c3bd7a/2-the-latest-web-design-trends-together-with-betheme.png?utm_source=smashingmagazine.com&utm_medium=content&utm_campaign=march19'>Large preview</a>)" alt="One-color gradient overlay on a photo" >}}

<p>And this is how a radial two-color gradient looks on a plain background:</p>

{{< rimg href="https://bit.ly/bethemeimages" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/46b8216c-d25c-4f6e-8c2e-f7a93446f229/9-the-latest-web-design-trends-together-with-betheme.png" sizes="100vw" caption="Two-color gradient over a plain background. (Image source: <a href='https://themes.muffingroup.com/be/creative3/?utm_source=smashingmagazine.com&utm_medium=content&utm_campaign=march19'>themes.muffingroup</a>) (<a href='https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/46b8216c-d25c-4f6e-8c2e-f7a93446f229/9-the-latest-web-design-trends-together-with-betheme.png?utm_source=smashingmagazine.com&utm_medium=content&utm_campaign=march19'>Large preview</a>)" alt="Two-color gradient over a plain background" >}}

<p>The duotone effect was made popular by Spotify, the online music-streaming service. The service was searching for a bold identity for its brand and decided to use duotones in its design.</p>

<p>In the simplest terms, duotones are filters that replace the whites and blacks in a photo with two colors. Duotones can make almost any image match your company’s branding; simply use your brand’s primary color as the duotone filter.</p>

{{< rimg href="https://bit.ly/bethemeimages" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f241d74b-b86b-461b-a483-2d6e5c3c82d8/10-the-latest-web-design-trends-together-with-betheme.png" sizes="100vw" caption="A duotone in the hero image (Image source: <a href='https://themes.muffingroup.com/be/football/?utm_source=smashingmagazine.com&utm_medium=content&utm_campaign=march19'>themes.muffingroup</a>) (<a href='https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f241d74b-b86b-461b-a483-2d6e5c3c82d8/10-the-latest-web-design-trends-together-with-betheme.png?utm_source=smashingmagazine.com&utm_medium=content&utm_campaign=march19'>Large preview</a>)" alt="A duotone in the hero image" >}}

## 7. Bold Typography

<p>Most designers know that content should always come first in the design process. A design should honor the message that the product’s creators want to deliver to their users. Bold typography helps designers to achieve that. Massive, screen-dominating text puts the written content center stage.</p>

<p>Bold fonts serve a functional purpose &mdash; they make it <strong>easy to read</strong> the text. Consider the following example. This template is an excellent example of how powerful a bold font can be:</p>

{{< rimg href="https://bit.ly/bethemeimages" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a20bed13-4e74-4166-ae68-20c54803a498/5-the-latest-web-design-trends-together-with-betheme.png" sizes="100vw" caption="Designers can use bold typography to make text the focal point in a graphic.
