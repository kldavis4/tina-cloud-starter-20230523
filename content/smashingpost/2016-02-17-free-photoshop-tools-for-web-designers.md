Photoshop is still a favorite among a lot of web designers, and the right tools make it even more powerful than it already is. To help you <strong>boost productivity</strong>, save time and (obviously) nerves, we have picked some valuable Photoshop resources, plugins and scripts for you.

Some of them will speed up routine tasks so you can concentrate more on your actual work, others build a bridge between <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/professional-photoshop-techniques-tutorials/">Photoshop</a> and code so your design mockups can benefit from the best of both worlds. Unless otherwise noted, the resources are free to use and require Photoshop CC 2015.</p>
