## Typography: References and Useful Resources

The Taxonomy of Type
This article's purpose is to help us as designers to distinguish basic properties of types. It explains the type classification and provides examples of each type. Short, but nice article.

<a href="https://typedia.com/">Typedia: A Shared Encyclopedia of Typefaces</a>
Typedia is a resource to classify, categorize, and connect typefaces. It is a community website to classify typefaces and educate people about them, very much like a mix between IMDb and Wikipedia, but just for type. Anyone can join, add, and edit pages for typefaces or for the people behind the type.

<a href="https://www.fontshop.com/help/glossary.php">Typeface Anatomy and Glossary</a>
Many fonts have abbreviations in their names. Some relate to glyph sets and font formats, others to design traits and foundries, and so on. A comprehensive list of these abbreviations and their explanation can be found in The Abbreviated Typographer from Unzipped.

<a href="https://retinart.net/typography/marksunknown">Typographic Marks Unknown</a>
There are many typographic marks which are familiar to most, but understood by few. Most of these glyphs have interesting histories and evolutions as they survived the beatings given to them through rushed handwriting of scribes and misuses through history. They now mostly live on our keyboards and in our software, and a few are used often, so it seems only fitting to know where they come from and how to correctly use them.

## Finding The Right Type

The Right Font for the Job
A few years ago, you had to make a decision between TrueType or PostScript and Mac or Windows. Today, the choice is usually fairly simple: OpenType is the most convenient and full-featured font format, compatible with all modern screen and print workflows. All the extras that are commonly spread across multiple PostScript or TrueType files can live in one OpenType file. Best of all, OpenType is a truly cross-platform format. You can use the same font on Mac or Windows machines without converting the font or fearing reflow.

<a href="https://fontfeed.com/archives/erik-spiekermanns-typo-tips/">Erik Spiekermann's Typo Tips</a>
With the invention of "desktop publishing", designers found themselves setting type on their computers for the first time. Until then, they had made type specifications for typesetters and left the job up to the professionals. As a result, you can still see classic inaccuracies in typesetting, even in top-quality printed matter. Here you will find some tips from Erik Spiekermann, designer of FF MetaÂ¨, Meta Design founder, co-author of 'stop Stealing Sheep", and a FontShop founder, which will prevent some of the more obvious blunders.

<a href="https://www.designobserver.com/observatory/entry.html?entry=5497">Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Typeface</a>
For the first ten years of my career, I worked for Massimo Vignelli, a designer who is legendary for using a very limited number of typefaces. Between 1980 and 1990, most of my projects were set in five fonts: Helvetica (naturally), Futura, Garamond No. 3, Century Expanded, and, of course, Bodoni.

Picking Type for Web
Picking Type for Web As a part of the visual design process for MIX Online's upcoming redesign, I've been experimenting with typography. The task of finding a typeface that's both aesthetically pleasing and legible, however, is a tricky one.

<a href="https://justcreativedesign.com/2007/12/04/how-to-choose-a-font/">How To Choose A Font</a>
Have you ever had the problem of not knowing what typeface to use? Well of course you have, everyone has. This is a guide on how to choose a font. These pointers have been gathered from Robin Williams great book "The Non-Designers Type Book" that I recommended in the top 5 typography resources of all time. Have a think about each of these before choosing your next font.

Typography is not a science. Typography is an art. There are those who"d like to 'scientificize"; those who believe that a large enough sample of data will somehow elicit good typography. However, this sausage-machine mentality will only ever produce sausages. That typography and choosing type is not a science trammeled by axioms and rules is a cause to rejoice.

## Combining Type

Is there a way to know what fonts will work together? Building a palette is an intuitive process, but expanding a typographic duet to three, four, or even five voices can be daunting. Here are four tips for navigating the typographic ocean, all built around H&amp;FJ's Highly Scientific First Principle of Combining Fonts: keep one thing consistent, and let one thing vary.

How do I choose paring fonts ?
When I have to chose type for a project, I always rely on my feelings and lots of testing, wating for the love/hate Alchemy to happen and decide for me. This method, mostly based on luck, is often time consuming, and I often found myself needing to ask for help on the forums.

<a href="https://www.magnetstudio.com/words/2010/opentype-guide">Beginner's Guide to OpenType</a>
OpenType (OT) is a cross-platform type format that includes expert layout features to provide richer linguistic support and advanced typographic control. Using OT technology you can substitute your characters for different glyphs1 using many different methods; Ligatures, Small Caps, Oldstyle Figures, Fractions, Superscript/Subscript, Ordinals, Alternates, Titling Characters and many more. This beginner's guide will help to illustrate some of the more common features found in OT fonts and when they should be used.

<a href="https://typographica.org/2010/on-typography/making-geometric-type-work/">Making Geometric Type Work</a>
For graphic designers beginning to experiment in type design, a geometric or modular typeface is a natural starting point. Illustrator and other programs offer a simple collection of elements such as circles, squares, and triangles which can be combined to create a passable alphabet. This is the same route I took when dissatisfied with the limits of commercial fonts at the time. I twisted and distorted each character to fit into a few simple, incredibly strict rules of construction. Invariably this produced a wide range of exotic letterforms, some more legible that others.

Teaching on a postgraduate course feels very much like a spiral: the annual repetition of projects, each a vehicle for a journey of education and discovery for the student, blurs into cyclical clouds of shapes, paragraphs, and personalities. There seems to be little opportunity for reflection across student cohorts, and yet it is only this process that improves the process from one year to the next. Having passed the tenth anniversary of the MA Typeface Design programme was as good an opportunity as any to reflect, and ILT's offer to publish the result an ideal environment to get some ideas out in the open. Although my perspective is unavoidably linked to the course at Reading, I think that the points I make have wider relevance.

A nice case-study about the creation process of the Vesper typeface, from its designer Rob Keller. "Vesper was developed over the course of almost three years. For this article, I've divided the process into two stages: #1 during my studies at the University of Reading; and #2 After Reading. Hopefully through this highly-condensed-yet-still-rather-wordy account of this project you will learn some interesting bits regarding my first major type family, the design process, and the MATD program."

The service allows you to add typographic accents and special characters (e.g. punctuation marks) as you're typing. Instead of clicking on buttons for the accents, you can also use pre-defined shortcuts, like Control + N, to insert the characters: just point your cursor to the desired character and you'll see a tooltip.

As we"re collaborating with multiple authors on the FontFeed, we compiled a list of guidelines for ourselves and guest contributors.

Are you a sharp shootin' font-master or a no-good calamity who can't spell Futura? To prove your design know how, shoot the font mounted on a target which is displayed on the banner.
