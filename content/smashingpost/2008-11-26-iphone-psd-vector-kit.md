### Behind the design

As always, here are some insights from the designer herself:

"This iPhone Vector Pack was created entirely in Photoshop. The elements in this set are a combination of vector and real screenshots. Last month, I was asked to create a mobile website mock-up using the iPhone as a medium. I needed to show several parts of the interface, none of which I had graphics for. I set out to create an iPhone "starter kit" for myself.

This iPhone Vector Pack comes with several button elements, as well as six different iPhone interface options (which you can turn on and off in Photoshop). I hope this freebie pack will be useful for mobile developers and front-end designers who need a professional way to show mock-ups to clients or to work out ideas."

Thank you very much, Renee! We appreciate your efforts.</p>
