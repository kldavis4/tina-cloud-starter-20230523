What once sounded like science fiction has become a reality: All you need is to grab a VR headset or simply use your web browser and you suddenly find yourself in an entirely different place, a different time, or in the middle of your favorite game.

Augmented and virtual reality are changing the way we experience and interact with the world around us — from the way we consume media and shop to the way we communicate and learn. Careless of whether you’re skeptical of this evolution or just can’t wait to fully immerse yourself in virtual worlds, one thing is for sure: Exciting times are ahead of us.

To share their excitement about AR and VR, the creative folks at [Vexels](https://www.vexels.com/) have designed a free set of 33 icons that take you on a journey through the new technology as well as the worlds it encompasses. The set includes useful icons of devices but also cute, cartoonish illustrations of people interacting with them. All icons are available in four formats (PNG, EPS, AI, and SVG) so you can resize and customize them until they match your project’s visual style perfectly. Happy exploring!

### Insights From The Designers

<blockquote>It seems like everyday there’s news about augmented and virtual reality devices and products, and we couldn’t be more excited about it! We can’t wait until cute animals guide us through the streets, video games come to life and we fully immerse in movies. When designing this pack we got carried away and ended up creating icons, avatars and illustrations of different people interacting with virtual worlds. We hope you find these devices, cartoons and scenarios both useful and exciting. The future is here!‌</blockquote>
