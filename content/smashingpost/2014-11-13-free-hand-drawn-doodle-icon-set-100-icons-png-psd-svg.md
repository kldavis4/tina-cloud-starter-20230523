  If you want to convey an intimate, personal atmosphere in your design, you
  can't rely on sterile, clean, pixel-perfect icons. So what about using
  **hand-drawn doodles** instead? That's why we're happy to release a quite
  special hand-drawn doodle icon set that has been created by _Roundicons_ and
  can be used for both private and commercial projects.

  This icon set is available under a [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0
  Unported](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) license. You may modify
  the size, color or shape of the icons. No attribution is required, however,
  reselling of bundles or individual pictograms isn't cool. Please always
  provide credits to the creators and link to the article in which this freebie
  was released if you would like to spread the word.

### Insights From The Designers:

<blockquote>"This set is a freedom from the restriction of perfect shapes and proportions. While creating the hand-drawn doodles, our main priority was to maintain a simplified free line art that can be used either as colored icons or just simple outlines. We think that these icons are the cutest that we have ever created until now! With 1000 illustrations so far covering over 20 different categories, we can easily say that this is the biggest hand-drawn doodles collection, offering not only a huge amount but great quality and harmony of colors and style. Enjoy using these icons and give your design a fresh and unique look! Break the boundaries! ;-)"</blockquote>
