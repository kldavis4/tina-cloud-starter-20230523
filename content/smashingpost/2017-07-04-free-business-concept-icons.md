  What comes to your mind when you hear the word “business”? White collars,
  cubicle offices, and encrusted habits? Not when you ask the folks at Vexels.
  Their _Business Concept_ icon set manages to break free from the conceptions
  that are stuck in our heads and paints a **fresh and creative** picture
  instead. One that captures the liveliness of today’s startup world. And, well,
  we are very happy to present you the icons as a freebie.

  Colorful, friendly, but nonetheless straight to the point, that’s Vexels’ take
  on the business subject. There are 28 icons in the set in total, depicting
  concepts that help a business thrive — from vision and strategy to teamwork
  and competition. All icons are available in AI, EPS, SVG, PSD, and PNG
  formats.
