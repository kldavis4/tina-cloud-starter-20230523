We all enjoyed returning to Toronto for the second Smashing conference, and in this post, I am sharing some of the things that took place as well as the resources that were shared over the course of the two conference and two workshop days. Look out for the videos of all the presentations which will be released very soon.

The team worked hard to create a friendly welcoming space for everyone at the conference. We all know how it can be a little overwhelming to walk into a room of a few hundred strangers, knowing that you would love to make friends and have interesting discussions, but finding it hard to get started.

In order to avoid that, we asked everyone to read and follow our Code Of Conduct, try to create a range of spaces and activities where people can meet like-minded people, and also encourage everyone to follow ‚Äú[The Pac-Man Rule](https://www.ericholscher.com/blog/2017/aug/2/pacman-rule-conferences/)‚Äù when standing in a group.

<blockquote>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a genuine friendliness that the Smashing team possesses, and that serves as the foundation for an inclusive, approachable event. It turns out that little things like launching balloons to kick off the event and advocating for the Pac-Man Rule go a long way towards making everyone feel welcome.‚Äù<br /><br />&mdash; <a href="https://weareadjacent.com/blog/smashingconf-toronto/">Dan Rose</a></blockquote>

## The Presentations

The first thing you think about when attending a conference is to wonder who is speaking, and what they will be talking about. At SmashingConf Toronto, we had an amazing lineup of speakers, with people you might know quite well plus some new faces. As many of our speakers presented without slides, we don‚Äôt have a huge number of slide decks to share. However, the list below links to some of the resources our speakers shared. We will also have videos available very soon!

### Day One

The [Day One Collaborative Doc](https://smashed.by/moon) created by attendees is full of takeaways from day one of the conference.

### Day Two

Check out the [Day Two Collaborative Doc](https://smashed.by/sun) for more resources and thoughts from our attendees and speakers.

Our mystery speaker was Seb Lester, and many of you were thrilled to get to hear his talk.

We then enjoyed talks covering a wide range of topics from our day two speakers.

We found a few blog posts sharing takeaways from these talks. Arshabhi Rai recapped [Day 1](https://solace.com/blog/smashingconf-toronto-day-1/) and [Day 2](https://solace.com/blog/smashingconf-toronto-2019-day-2/), and Qihuan Piao shared his takeaways in ‚Äú[What A Lovely SmashingConf!](https://bloggie.io/@kinopyo/what-a-lovely-smashingconf)‚Äù

## Workshops

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/marcthiele/albums/72157709506155361" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/fbf99f73-0f70-46a6-821c-23b711401508/vitaly-workshop.jpg" sizes="100vw" caption="Vitaly shares responsive design knowledge with his workshop group (<a href='https://marcthiele.com/'>Photo credit: Marc Thiele</a>)" alt="Auditorium style lecture room with people working on laptops" >}}

Our workshops are a big part of each of our Smashing conferences. In Toronto, we had two days of full-day workshops, with some attendees choosing to do a workshop day before _and_ after the conference. Workshops this time round were as follows:

## Side Activities

A conference isn‚Äôt just about the talks and speakers. We want to make spaces where attendees and speakers can learn from each other and share experiences in a more informal setting. To help with that, we ran various other things over the conference. At lunchtime, we had lunch sessions run by Deque on Day 1, and Netlify on Day 2, attendees could grab a plate of lunch and settle down in a more cozy environment to take part in those sessions.

We had a great lounge area, with the talks live-streamed for folks who wanted to step out of the movie theater for a while.

### Morning Run

If you follow me on Twitter, you‚Äôll know that I‚Äôm a keen runner, and it‚Äôs always nice to have some company on an early morning run. For a few conferences now, we‚Äôve been organizing pre-conference runs &mdash; Toronto was no exception. We had 12 runners on Day 1, and 6 hardy souls on Day 2 joining us despite having attended the party. We only got _slightly_ off-track once, and got a nice view of Toronto to take our photos.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Doing a lovely morning run with#smashingconf Toronto peoples <a href="https://t.co/rFmCKRZRxP">pic.twitter.com/rFmCKRZRxP</a></p>&mdash; Jarijn (@jarijn) <a href="https://twitter.com/jarijn/status/1143480050525724672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 25, 2019</a></blockquote>

### Jam Session

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">First Jam Session talk at <a href="https://twitter.com/Shopify?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@shopify</a> of the evening, <a href="https://twitter.com/tiffany_tse?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@tiffany_tse</a> talking about Building Accessible Experiences, while the volunteers dogsit Walnut.  <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SmashingConf?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SmashingConf</a> <a href="https://t.co/oCwnURjGHs">pic.twitter.com/oCwnURjGHs</a></p>&mdash; SmashingConf (@smashingconf) <a href="https://twitter.com/smashingconf/status/1143318117541507073?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 25, 2019</a></blockquote>
<script defer  src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

On the evening before the conference, we had a [Jam Session at Shopify](https://smashingconf.com/toronto-2019/jam-session) hosted by [Tiffany Tse](https://smashingconf.com/toronto-2019/jam-session) (and her lovely assistant Walnut). There was a speaker panel featuring Steven Hoober, Scott Jehl, Kristina Podnar, Brad Frost, Jules Forrest, Phil Hawksworth and myself, plus lightning talks from [Tiffany Tse](https://twitter.com/tiffany_tse), [Kelly Harrop](https://kellyharrop.com/), [April Ellsey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aprilellsey/), [Steve Pereira](https://twitter.com/SteveElsewhere), and [Christine Fowler](https://twitter.com/KristinFowler).

### Graffiti And Photo Walks

On the day before and last evening of the conference, walks took place to explore graffiti around Toronto and take photos of the city. A great way to meet people and explore the location for those coming from out of town.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f6da85c2-a301-4bc0-9e99-fac9a5e7347c/photowalk.jpg" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f6da85c2-a301-4bc0-9e99-fac9a5e7347c/photowalk.jpg" sizes="100vw" caption="On the graffiti walk (Photo credit: <a href='https://twitter.com/scottwhitebread'>Scott Whitehead</a>)" alt="People in a street taking photos of graffiti" >}}

### Conference Party

There has to be a party, and we always try to do something fun and perhaps a little unusual for our conference parties. This time, we went bowling &mdash; courtesy of sponsorship by [SpeedCurve](https://speedcurve.com/).

## Focus On The Local Community

Between sessions on stage, we invited organizers of community groups in the Toronto area on stage to share information about their groups. We hope that local attendess found some new meetups to go to. The groups that we featured were:
