## Baseline

### Have a Strategy for Staying Up to Date

<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/chriscoyier/how-to-stay-up-to-date-on-web-technology">How to Stay Up to Date on Web Stuff</a>, Chris Coyier

Part of continually developing your craft is staying up to date. Doing this is important for all professionals, and in this talk you’ll learn strategies for staying updated even when the ideas that surround the technologies we use are constantly evolving.

<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/chriscoyier/how-to-stay-up-to-date-on-web-technology"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4c7016f5-eb7d-4843-8fba-b42540bb2cc5/screen-shot-2012-12-16-at-23.53" alt="Screenshot" /></a>

### Make Sure Your Baseline for Development Is Current

<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/rmurphey/a-new-baseline-for-front-end-devs">A New Baseline for Front-End Developers</a>, Rebecca Murphey

There was a time when editing files, testing them locally and simply FTP’ing them was the common workflow for a front-end developer. We would measure our abilities based on how well we could harass IE 6 into rendering pages correctly, and we generally lacked strong skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This has greatly changed over the past few years, with improvements in workflow and tooling. Front-end development is now taken more seriously, and this talk sheds light on the new baseline process for developing on the front end.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/6fcf11f8-7a0b-47e6-a8ad-915f18dd25c2/screen-shot-2012-12-17-at-20.16" alt="Screenshot" />

### Understand How Browsers Work Behind the Scenes

<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/dmosher/so-you-want-to-be-a-front-end-engineer">So, You Want to Be a Front-End Engineer</a>, David Mosher (<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=Lsg84NtJbmI">Video</a>)

Some would say that the browser is the most volatile development platform the world has ever known. If you’re a client-side developer, understanding how browser internals work can help you both make better decisions and appreciate the justifications behind many development best practices. In one of the best talks this year, David Mosher takes you through how browsers parse and render your pages.

<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/dmosher/so-you-want-to-be-a-front-end-engineer"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/01564cba-f6ad-4cdd-96b0-172db1bd085f/screen-shot-2012-12-16-at-23.53" alt="Screenshot" /></a>

### Know What the Web Platform Now Has to Offer

<a href="https://www.htmlfivecan.com/#1">The Web Can Do That!?</a>, Eric Bidelman (<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=X_ek1wSe66o">Video</a>)

The Web is constantly evolving, and keeping up with what’s new on the platform can be hard. HTML5’s new capabilities enable us to build an entirely new suite of applications with features that were simply impossible to achieve before (at least, not without the use of plugins) but are now a reality.

In this talk, my teammate Eric guides you through the bleeding edge of HTML5, focusing on solving many real-world problems. You’ll learn about media streaming, device input, modern CSS design, media capture, file I/O and more.

<a href="https://www.htmlfivecan.com/#1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/01d38ce4-29f0-45f7-be9e-8c0ad09cada8/screen-shot-2012-12-16-at-23.57" alt="Screenshot" /></a>

## Workflow

### For Web App Developers

<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/addyosmani/tooling-for-the-modern-webapp-developer">Tooling for the Modern Web App Developer</a>, Addy Osmani

Whether you’re using JavaScript or CoffeeScript, LESS or Sass, building an awesome Web application these days usually requires a plethora of boilerplates, frameworks and tools and a lot of glue to get them to work together. In short, you need a kick-ass utility belt.

In this talk, you’ll get an overview of the current tooling eco-system for the front-end and learn about a new tool that tries to bring together all of the pieces of this eco-system for you, called <a href="https://yeoman.io">Yeoman</a>.

<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/addyosmani/tooling-for-the-modern-webapp-developer"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/62342552-71bf-43e1-a614-733e1a665f88/screen-shot-2012-12-17-at-00.03" alt="Screenshot" /></a>

An <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/addyosmani/the-new-wave-utility-belt-fowa">extended version</a> of this talk is also available.</p>

### For Web Designers

<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/chriscoyier/a-modern-web-designers-workflow">A Modern Web Designer’s Workflow</a>, Chris Coyier (<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=vsTrAfJFLXI">Video</a>)

A lot is expected from today’s Web designers. If this role defines what you do, then it’s now not just about visual design, but increasingly about building interactions. Designs need to work across different devices of varying shapes, sizes and connections, and they also need to be accessible.

As a designer, you often need to communicate and share code across teams and be familiar with many different technologies. In this talk, Chris Coyier discusses many of the amazing tools that can help things along, discussing what does what and giving a high-level view of a modern workflow.

<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/chriscoyier/a-modern-web-designers-workflow"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/edbc4559-eee9-4081-9e09-3d42632eec3e/screen-shot-2012-12-17-at-00.07" alt="Screenshot" /></a>

### For Mobile Web Developers

<a href="https://petelepage.com/presentations/2012/qcon/#2">Mobile Web Developers Toolbelt</a>, Pete Le Page (<a href="https://developers.google.com/live/shows/11154750/">Video</a>)

Building for the mobile Web requires a different mindset to the one we use when developing for desktop, and a different set of tools. Thankfully, a number of great options are available. From remote debugging to emulation, mobile browsers are offering more and more tools to make our lives easier.

In this talk, Pete Le Page takes you through a couple of tools that you can use today to make cross-platform mobile Web development easier, and then he peers into the crystal ball to see what tools the future may bring.

<a href="https://petelepage.com/presentations/2012/qcon/#2"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/1c72b05d-f766-43e7-9f95-6bb846d1fbde/screen-shot-2012-12-17-at-00.04" alt="Screenshot" /></a>

### For Debugging

Secrets of the Chrome DevTools, Patrick Dubroy (<a href="https://vimeo.com/53073654">Video</a>)

Google Chrome Developer Tools provide powerful ways to understand, debug and profile Web applications. Most developers are familiar with Chrome’s basic inspection and debugging tools, but some of its most valuable features, like the <a href="https://addyosmani.com/blog/performance-optimisation-with-timeline-profiles/">Timeline</a> and memory analysis tools, are less known.

In his demo-based walkthrough, Patrick Dubroy provides an overview of Chrome Developer Tools and an in-depth demonstration of some lesser-known features.

## The Future

### CSS

<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/stopsatgreen/the-css-of-tomorrow-revised">The CSS of Tomorrow</a>, Peter Gasston

In this talk, Peter looks briefly at the state of CSS3: what you can do right now, and what you’ll be able to do in the very near future. He then looks into the long-term future, to a time when CSS3 will make possible page layouts far richer and more dynamic than we’d thought possible, and when CSS3 has taken on aspects of programming languages. This is effectively what CSS developers will be learning years from now.

<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/stopsatgreen/the-css-of-tomorrow-revised"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/39cd650c-9ea9-44c2-8eee-7e6064ba6595/screen-shot-2012-12-16-at-23.59" alt="Screenshot" /></a>

### JavaScript

<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/dherman/the-future-of-javascript-1">The Future of JavaScript</a>, Dave Herman

The Web platform is growing, and JavaScript is growing along with it. EcmaScript 6, the next edition of the JavaScript standard, is gearing up to be a huge step forward for Web programming. In this talk, Dave Herman discusses the exciting <a href="https://addyosmani.com/blog/a-few-new-things-coming-to-javascript/">new features</a> being worked on for EcmaScript 6 and how they can be used.

<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/dherman/the-future-of-javascript-1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/83e9b5a4-e741-4cc5-b629-7bfa2e0811c6/screen-shot-2012-12-17-at-00.00" alt="Screenshot" /></a>

### Web Applications

<a href="https://html5-demos.appspot.com/static/webcomponents/index.html#1">Web Components and the Future of Web App Development</a>, Eric Bidelman

Web components are going to fundamentally change the way we think, build and consume Web apps. <a href="https://glazkov.com/2011/01/14/what-the-heck-is-shadow-dom/">ShadowDOM</a>, <a href="https://updates.html5rocks.com/2012/02/Detect-DOM-changes-with-Mutation-Observers">Mutation Observers</a>, custom elements, MDV, <a href="https://weblog.bocoup.com/javascript-object-observe/">Object.observe()</a>, CSS — how do they all fit together?

This talk prepares you for the future of the Web platform by discussing the fundamentals of Web components and how we can use them today with frameworks such as AngularJS.

<a href="https://html5-demos.appspot.com/static/webcomponents/index.html#1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/48319519-96df-48ca-acab-56c8bc7556ac/screen-shot-2012-12-17-at-00.02" alt="Screenshot" /></a>

## CSS

### State of the Art

All the New CSS Hawtness, Darcy Clarke

This talk dives into some of the latest CSS implementations and specifications floating around. You’ll learn what’s here and what’s around the corner, and you’ll gain insight into why these new features will change our development workflow.

Darcy Clarke touches on modules such as <a href="https://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-page/">paged-media</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/Using_CSS_multi-column_layouts">multi-columns</a>, <a href="https://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-flexbox/">flex-box</a>, <a href="https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/filters/understanding-css/">filters</a>, <a href="https://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-regions/">regions</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/box-sizing">box-sizing</a>, masking and 3D.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2639860a-d7f5-4679-a235-8c7576598f7b/screen-shot-2012-12-17-at-21.19" alt="Screenshot" />

### Modularity

<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/snookca/your">Your CSS Is a Mess</a>, Jonathan Snook

We all think that CSS is easy. Take some selectors, add some properties, maybe a dash of media queries, and — presto! — you have a beautiful website. And yet, as the project changes and the team grows, we see the frustration build, with increasingly complex selectors and overuse of <code>!important</code>.

In this talk, Jonathan looks at common problems and solutions that will make your CSS (and your projects) easier to manage and easier to scale.

<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/snookca/your"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/cfea81e2-8aa1-43c0-b68b-bf52e3a51475/screen-shot-2012-12-17-at-11.54" alt="Screenshot" /></a>

### Pre-Processors

<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/bermonpainter/css-pre-processors-stylus-less-and-sass">CSS Pre-Processors</a>, Bermon Painter

If you haven’t jumped on the pre-processor train this year, you’re missing out. In this helpful overview of (current) popular pre-processors, Bermon Painter takes you through Stylus, LESS and Sass, with features subdivided into easy-to-learn sections of beginner, intermediate and advanced. I’ve been using mixins quite heavily this year, and I simply wouldn’t have been able to if it weren’t for projects like Sass.

<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/bermonpainter/css-pre-processors-stylus-less-and-sass"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/284c8b98-68cb-492d-ad58-6310b7e67a47/screen-shot-2012-12-17-at-11.56" alt="Screenshot" /></a>

### Documentation

<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/kneath/a-better-future-with-kss">A Better Future With KSS</a>, Kyle Neath

Writing maintainable CSS within a team is one of those problems that a lot of people think can be solved by writing CSS in a particular style. But in Kyle’s experience, that never works out.

In this talk, he introduces you to his latest creation, <a href="https://github.com/kneath/kss">KSS</a>. It’s a documentation and style guide format. He’ll show you why he built KSS and how it’s been helping him at GitHub to refactor its four-and-a-half year old CSS, and he’ll give you a glimpse into the future of KSS.

<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/kneath/a-better-future-with-kss"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2a260352-2328-4608-ba33-9b5a737cc813/screen-shot-2012-12-17-at-11.57" alt="Screenshot" /></a>

## JavaScript

### The Importance of Code Style

<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/nzakas/maintainable-javascript-2012">Maintainable JavaScript</a>, Nicholas Zakas

Some say that good code is its own documentation, and the fact is that the more readable our code is, the easier it is to maintain.

Writing JavaScript for fun and writing it professionally are two different things, and in this talk by Zakas, you’ll learn practices to make JavaScript maintainable over the long run, to reduce errors and to make your code easily adaptable to future changes. It’s highly recommended reading.

<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/nzakas/maintainable-javascript-2012"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/cae9353b-e634-4952-a695-44d81110b5b8/screen-shot-2012-12-18-at-10.43" alt="Screenshot" /></a>

### A Modern Large-Scale App Stack

<a href="https://spadgos.github.com/sfjs-next-soundcloud/#/step-1">SoundCloud’s Stack</a>, Nick Fisher

I’ve talked a lot about <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/addyosmani/large-scale-javascript-application-architecture">large-scale development</a> in the past. It’s a non-trivial problem that’s difficult to get right, and so it’s exciting when someone working on such challenges shares their experience.

In this talk, Nick Fisher of <a href="https://soundcloud.com/">SoundCloud</a> discusses the company’s story of developing large-scale applications with JavaScript, not only at runtime, but also its steps to make development and deployment easier. In particular, he looks at <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/12/talks-to-help-you-become-a-better-front-end-engineer-in-2013/">RequireJS</a> and <a href="https://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a>, talking about how SoundCloud has used and abused each to suit its needs, sometimes in uncommon ways.

<a href="https://spadgos.github.com/sfjs-next-soundcloud/#/step-1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/24a8328a-cdb4-4567-860d-66b39bd959d0/screen-shot-2012-12-20-at-02.19" alt="Screenshot" /></a>

### Rethinking Application Structure

<a href="https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/presentation/pub?id=1kDvp3O2xZ6ZSXF4F1YTbg_jy_ei2sFl38f3c6VkBfSo&amp;start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000#slide=id.p">Re-Imagining the Browser With AngularJS</a>, Igor Minar

What if you could a write modern Web app with dramatically fewer lines of code and improve its readability and expressiveness at the same time? In case you’re wondering: no, there’s no new language to learn, just familiar old HTML and JavaScript. As a matter of fact, there are concepts for you to unlearn.

AngularJS is a client-side JavaScript Web development framework whose authors believe they’ve done something special. Instead of asking what kind of functions they could provide to make writing apps smoother, they asked, “What if the browser worked differently in a way that eliminates code and gives structure to apps?”

In this talk, you’ll get a tour of how to get the power of tomorrow’s Web platform in today’s Web applications.

<a href="https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/presentation/pub?id=1kDvp3O2xZ6ZSXF4F1YTbg_jy_ei2sFl38f3c6VkBfSo&amp;start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000#slide=id.p"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/af0fcb73-318e-4f9f-8eaa-195dc4126bcf/screen-shot-2012-12-18-at-10.46" alt="Screenshot" /></a>

### Internationalization and i18n

<a href="https://i18n.asciidisco.com/#/">Entschuldigen you, parlez vouz JavaScript</a>, Sebastian Golasch (<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=ekiZuLl1mWc">Video</a>)

While JavaScript applications grow in size and complexity, there are still some white spots on the big map of Web applications: internationalization and globalization! If you´re still thinking that switching strings in and out is the way to go, you are definitely headed in the wrong direction.

In this talk, Sebastian takes you through how to spot real-world internationalization problems and how to solve them in the most elegant way.

<a href="https://i18n.asciidisco.com/#/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2959b261-ae49-4b62-9d5e-8158d2d6ecaa/screen-shot-2012-12-18-at-11.59" alt="Screenshot" /></a>

I couldn’t cover internationalization without mentioning Alex Sexton, who has also spoken a great deal on this topic. His JSConf talk on client-side internationalization is <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=uXS_-JRsB8M">available in video</a> form if you’re interested in checking it out.</p>

### Patterns and Principles

<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/bkeepers/the-plight-of-pinocchio">The Plight of Pinocchio</a>, Brandon Keepers

JavaScript is no longer a toy language, and many of our Web applications can’t function without it. Brandon states that if we are going to use JavaScript to do real things, then we need to treat it like a real language, adopting the same practices that we use with real languages. I completely agree with him.

This framework-agnostic talk takes a serious look at how we develop JavaScript applications in the real world. Despite their prototypical nature, good object-oriented programming principles are still relevant. The <a href="https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/">design patterns</a> that we’ve grown to know and love work just as well in JavaScript as they do in any other language.

<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/bkeepers/the-plight-of-pinocchio"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e7d82667-9457-48b1-9699-f6ea44a1fae2/screen-shot-2012-12-17-at-21.59" alt="Screenshot" /></a>

### When to Lazy Load Scripts

<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/mmarcon/how-late-is-later-a-lazy-loading-solution-on-the-edge-between-very-clever-and-incredibly-mad">How Late Is Later?</a>, Massimiliano Marcon

Reducing the loading time of a Web application is a well-known challenge. Developers need to make sure that the browser downloads only the code that is strictly necessary to bootstrap the application, and leave the rest for later. This is what we commonly call “lazy loading.”

But when is “later”? When is the right time to lazy load? This talk shows how JavaScript code — functions and objects — can be delivered to the browser on demand, thus reducing the perceived loading time of a Web application.

<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/mmarcon/how-late-is-later-a-lazy-loading-solution-on-the-edge-between-very-clever-and-incredibly-mad"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e21def71-4d93-4d1d-9824-12c5180d7df7/screen-shot-2012-12-18-at-10.43" alt="Screenshot" /></a>

## Mobile

### Building Touch-Based Interfaces

<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/ysaw/html5-touch-interfaces-sxsw-extended-version">Creating Responsive HTML5 Touch Interfaces</a>, Stephen Woods (<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=lcD9CF0bxyk">Video</a> | <a href="https://audio.sxsw.com/2012/podcasts/11-HIL-Creating_Responsive_HTML5_Touch_Interfaces.mp3">Audio</a>)

Flickr front-end engineer Stephen Woods shares some hard-learned lessons about building responsive touch-based interfaces using HTML5 and CSS. Because our users are demanding better instant feedback from touch-based UIs, understanding how to approach this problem and avoid the pitfalls will be critical for many application developers in the future.

<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/ysaw/html5-touch-interfaces-sxsw-extended-version"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/6692d183-4c77-434a-a579-d2a586ae6eff/screen-shot-2012-12-18-at-11.11" alt="Screenshot" /></a>

### The Challenge With Scrolling

<a href="https://markdalgleish.com/presentations/embracingtouch/">Embracing Touch: Cross-Platform Scrolling</a>, Mark Dalgleish (<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=Ii5AkRNSVHg">Video</a>)

Scrolling effects are a popular way to add personality to the simple act of moving down the page. Unfortunately, these effects don’t work natively on mobile devices, where the touch interaction would make these techniques more effective. In this talk, Mark looks at some ways to implement these effects within the limitations of mobile browsers.

### Native, HTML5 and Hybrid Apps

<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/zzeran/fowa-2012-native-html5-and-hybrid-mobile-app-development-reallife-experiences-eran-zinman">Native, HTML5 and Hybrid Mobile Development</a>, Eran Zinman

One of the toughest decisions every mobile developer faces is choosing a development strategy: “Should I develop a native, HTML5 or hybrid mobile app?” Over the past two years, Eran has led Conduit’s mobile client development efforts, experimenting with cross-platform development in various flavors: from complete HTML5 solutions (using PhoneGap and other technologies) to hybrid solutions to semi-hybrid solutions to fully native solutions.

In this talk, Eran shares some real-life experiences in cross-platform development, describing changes that Conduit has implemented along the way, and sharing what some of the “big players” (such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter) are doing in their mobile app development.

### Performance, Distribution and Facebook on HTML5

<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/sicross/on-the-future-of-mobile-web-apps">On the Future of Mobile Web Apps</a>, Simon Cross

Simon looks at Facebook’s experience with and investment in the mobile Web, the issues affecting mobile Web developers and what Facebook and the industry are doing to push the mobile Web forward. Mark Zuckerberg’s comments on HTML5 were undoubtedly one of the most discussed topics in mobile this year, and I personally found these slides a good summary of Facebook’s current take on what works and what still requires improvement.

### Tools for Mobile Debugging

<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/rem/mobile-debugging">Mobile Debugging</a>, Remy Sharp

Debugging Web apps on mobile devices can be a genuine pain. Luckily, a number of tools are available today to ease the process. From remote debuggers to cross-device consoles, this talk summarizes the current state of debugging for mobile, going into more depth on debugging than Pete’s talk from earlier in the post.

### Responsive Design Techniques

<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/smashingmag/responsive-web-design-clever-tips-and-techniques">Responsive Web Design: Clever Tips and Techniques</a>, Vitaly Friedman

Responsive Web design challenges designers to apply a new mindset to their design processes and to the techniques they use in design and coding. This talk (by Smashing Magazine’s own Vitaly Friedman) provides an overview of various practical techniques, tips and tricks that you might want to be aware of when working on a new responsive design project.

## Web Apps

### Offline Web Apps

<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/triblondon/offline-rules-full-frontal-2012">Offline Rules</a>, Andrew Betts (<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=RrGo1Sz4IgQ">Video</a>)

In the last couple of years, a deluge of new offline storage technologies have appeared. In this talk, Andrew looks at why they are all excellent and rubbish at the same time and why you need to use all of them, and he walks through techniques to consider when building a Web application that can load and function with no network connectivity.

But making use of client-side storage is necessary not only in order to make an app that works offline, but it can also hugely improve the experience of your website when the user actually does have connectivity.

### State of the Art

<a href="https://lanyrd.com/2012/full-frontal/sztqg/">Building Web Apps of the Future: Tomorrow, Today and Yesterday</a>, Paul Kinlan (Audio)

The browser is an amazing runtime that can already deliver amazing apps. Paul dives into the technologies that will help you deliver Web apps that will blow your users’ socks off now and in the future.

<a href="https://lanyrd.com/2012/full-frontal/sztqg/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/48542141-86ca-470c-ab07-4b338de76543/screen-shot-2012-12-18-at-10.54" alt="Screenshot" /></a>

### Client-Side Storage

<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/triblondon/storage-in-the-browser-londonjs">Storage in the Browser</a>, Andrew Betts

Installed native applications can use all the space they want, but in the browser we’re much more limited. This talk explores how to make the best use of the storage technologies available to Web apps, comparing the virtues of different packaging and encoding techniques, and covering simple forms of in-browser compression that can yield surprising results.

As more apps are developed to surf over network turbulence, and to work even when completely disconnected from the network, local storage becomes ever more important.

<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/triblondon/storage-in-the-browser-londonjs"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/6dd8979f-a9c1-458e-9066-192eed53ffa9/screen-shot-2012-12-18-at-10.54" alt="Screenshot" /></a>

### Application Cache

<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jaffathecake/application-cache-douchebag">Application Cache: Douchebag</a>, Jake Archibald (<span class="removed_link" title="https://vimeo.com/43336762">Video</span>)

The Application Cache is one of the cool bits of HTML5. It allows websites to work without a network connection, and it brings us much closer to native app-like behavior. However, from roundup articles and talks about HTML5, you might be left with the impression that it’s a magic bullet. Unfortunately, it isn’t; the Application Cache is, as Jake famously puts it, a douchebag.

In this talk, he looks at how to use the features of Application Cache without the horrible side effects, comparing techniques that you’d use for both a simple client-side app and a large content-driven website. He explores the many gotchas left out of most articles about Application Cache and discusses how to build your website to survive them.

## Performance

### CSS

<a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/39519/talks/cssperf-cssdevconf/index.html">High-Performance CSS</a>, Paul Irish

Paul dives into the tools available in and outside of the browser to assess the performance of your CSS. Find out what’s slow (is <code>box-shadow</code> causing paints to be 70 milliseconds longer?) and how to fix it. Learn about <code>about:tracing</code>, CSS profiling and speed tracer, and get a better understanding of the browser’s internals in the process.

### Avoiding Jank

<a href="https://jankfree.com/velocity-europe/index.html">Jank-Free: In Pursuit of Smooth Web Apps</a>, Tom Wiltzius

Building beautiful experiences on the mobile Web takes more than a good designer and fancy CSS: performance is critical for a Web app to feel fluid. Smooth animation that never drops a frame can give your app a native feel. But when animations stutter, effects lag or pages scroll slowly, we call that “jank.” This talk is about identifying jank and getting rid of it.

<a href="https://jankfree.com/velocity-europe/index.html"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/350c9651-b1ac-4064-aa60-cc7211205d6d/screen-shot-2012-12-17-at-10.46" alt="Screenshot" /></a>

### Web

<a href="https://www.igvita.com/slides/2012/webperf-crash-course.pdf">Building Faster Websites</a>, Ilya Grigorik

In this comprehensive crash course, Ilya Grigorik shares some really juicy tips on how to make the Web faster, including Google’s findings on what slows down people’s Web experience and how Chrome and other services have improved it. If you’re an engineer looking to improve the performance of your websites or apps, this talk comes highly recommended.

<a href="https://www.igvita.com/slides/2012/webperf-crash-course.pdf"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8570629f-c211-48b3-8c94-005e31fc25ed/screen-shot-2012-12-17-at-10.45" alt="Screenshot" /></a>

### JavaScript

<a href="https://v8-io12.appspot.com/">Breaking the JavaScript Speed Limit With V8</a>, Daniel Clifford

Are you interested in making JavaScript run blazingly fast? If so, this talk looks at V8 under the hood to help you identify how to optimize your JavaScript. Daniel shows you how to leverage V8’s sampling profiler to eliminate performance bottlenecks and optimize JavaScript programs. He also exposes how V8 uses hidden classes and runtime-type feedback to generate efficient JIT code. A very interesting talk for performance junkies.

<a href="https://v8-io12.appspot.com/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e9edf65f-c16e-4ffb-87c5-8d877cff2c35/screen-shot-2012-12-17-at-10.51" alt="Screenshot" /></a>

Note: Some of the optimizations mentioned in this talk are specific to V8 and may not apply to other JavaScript engines. I wrote about <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/11/05/writing-fast-memory-efficient-javascript/">how to write memory-efficient JavaScript</a> on Smashing Magazine recently, in case you’re interested in exploring the topic further.</p>

## Testing

### Understanding Code Smells

<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/bkeepers/why-our-code-smells">Why Our Code Smells</a>, Brandon Keepers (<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=JxPKljUkFQw">Video</a>)

Odors exist for a reason, and they are usually trying to tell us something. If our code smells, it might be trying to tell us what is wrong.

Does a test case require an abundance of setting up? Maybe the code being tested is doing too much, or it is not isolated enough for the test? Does an object have an abundance of instance variables? Maybe it should be split into multiple objects? Is a view brittle? Maybe it is too tightly coupled to a model, or maybe the logic needs to be abstracted into an object that can be tested?

In this talk, Brandon walks through code from projects that he works on every day, looking for smells that indicate problems, understanding why the smells are there, what the smells are trying to tell us, and how to refactor them.

### Current State of the Art

JavaScript Testing: The Holy Grail, Adam Hawkins (<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=YdFQ29oK50M">Video</a>)

Adam talks about this Holy Grail for JavaScript developers: getting a test suite up and running fast and having multiple browsers execute the tests. Getting the Holy Grail is difficult, though, even though several tools have been created in the past in attempts to solve this problem.

Barriers to entries are everywhere. How easy is it to get going testing small parts of JavaScript functionality? What happens as your become bigger and more complex? What about headless testing? Does this process scale up to CI? Can you even do this stuff locally?

A myriad of testing tools and solutions are available, and Adam shows what’s out there and what we as a community need to do next to get the Holy Grail, to ensure a better Web experience for everyone.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/72a28dff-6172-4989-a0a7-443b158c6596/screen-shot-2012-12-17-at-21.03" alt="Screenshot" />

Tip: One tool for testing that I’m loving at the moment is <a href="https://ci.testling.com/">Testling-CI</a>, which runs browser tests on every push.</p>

### Improving the Testability of Your Code

<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/rmurphey/writing-testable-javascript-mocha-version">Writing Testable JavaScript</a>, Rebecca Murphey (Audio)

It’s one thing to write the code that you need to write to get something working; quite another to write the code that you need to write to prove that it works — and to prove that it will continue to work as you refactor and add new features.

In her talk, Rebecca looks at what it means to write testable JavaScript code.

<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/rmurphey/writing-testable-javascript-mocha-version"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d45c9643-63ae-4870-8266-a9629b41cbc2/screen-shot-2012-12-17-at-10.49" alt="Screenshot" /></a>

## Conclusion

Time spent thinking about (and developing) your craft is time <strong>well spent</strong>. The more honed your skills are, the more opportunity you will have to become an efficient engineer.

While this list doesn’t cover every excellent talk presented this year, it hopefully offers some <strong>direction</strong> for you to accentuate your skills. Do consider reading through a few of them. Focused reading in this way will add to your value as a craftsperson and hopefully improve your daily development workflow.

With that, do enjoy the holiday season and have a fantastic new year.
