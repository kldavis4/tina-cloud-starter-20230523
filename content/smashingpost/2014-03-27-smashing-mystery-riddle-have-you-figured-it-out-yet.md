By now, you might actually know how it works. The good ol' Smashing Mysteries: <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-smashing-book-mystery-is-resolved-gifs-crazy-people-all-that-malarkey/">the door that would never open</a> and <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-mystery-resolved-the-rain-that-never-stops-frightened-cats-cake-is-a-lie/">the rain that would never stop</a>. Well, the Mystery continues! To celebrate the launch of Paul Boag's <em>Digital Adaptation</em> book, we’ve prepared a new riddle, and this time it's a bit different and a bit easier.

How does it work? Below you'll find <strong>three animated GIFs that contain a hidden message</strong>. Each GIF contains a few scattered letters (all uppercase) that you can use to build words. Once you put the words from all the GIFs together, you will be able to create a sentence. Please notice that no letters should be left unused. Once you've resolved the mystery, please tweet the full sentence <code>@smashingmag</code> using the hashtag <code>#smashing</code>.</p>

### Are you ready? Action!

Watch out for the clues in the descriptions under each animation. Remember: <strong>the key is to build one meaningful sentence out of the words</strong> scattered all across the GIFs.

Perhaps it's just about time to do something about it. 3 words, 1 of them on the floor. <a href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/6576b81e-4975-464b-b925-1dfdec6755ba/change.gif">Large preview</a></figcaption></figure>

But if not you, who else will help the company and bring it on the right path? 3 words. <a href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/caa53fb4-6c60-40a8-a73b-39fd001ac738/convincing.gif">Large preview</a></figcaption></figure>

And who knows, in the end, it might turn out even better than you expected. 4 words. The letters on the floor belong together, in one word. <a href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/6246c078-bb7f-4c1b-8bbd-1bb71a1748ad/difference.gif">Large preview</a></figcaption></figure>
