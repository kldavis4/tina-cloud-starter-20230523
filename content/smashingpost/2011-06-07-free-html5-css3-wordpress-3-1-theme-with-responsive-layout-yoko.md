Yoko is a modern and flexible WordPress theme. With the responsive layout based on **CSS3 media queries**, the theme adjusts to different screen sizes. The design is optimized for big desktop screens, tablets and small smartphone screens. To make your blog more individual, you can use the new post formats (like gallery, aside or quote), choose your own logo and header image, customize the background and link color.

### Behind The Design

As always, here are some insights from the designers:
<blockquote>“Since the mobile Web is getting more and more popular every day, we think that it’s also time for WordPress themes to become more flexible and adapt to different devices and screen sizes. While designing the Yoko theme, our goal was to create a minimalistic design with focus on content and good readability on various devices. Also we wanted the theme to be easy to use and customizable for everybody, so we kept the theme options simple while still including the most important options to add a personal style to the theme.

The main problem to solve during the design and development process was to make sure that all the different contents and plugins that people will use still work in the responsive layout. Of course the responsive design approach is still in development but we think it’s a lot of fun to explore new possibilities and as doing so make Web design and WordPress themes more powerful and flexible to use.”</blockquote>

Thank you, Ellen and Manuel! We sincerely appreciate your work and your good intentions!
