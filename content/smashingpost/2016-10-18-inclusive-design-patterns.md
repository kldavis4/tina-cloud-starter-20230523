We might not realize it, but as developers, we build inaccessible websites all the time. It's not for the lack of care or talent though — it's a matter of doing things the wrong way. In our new book, _Inclusive Design Patterns_, we explore how we can craft **accessible interfaces** without extra effort — and what **front-end design patterns** we can use to create inclusive experiences. Hardcover, 312 pages. [Get the book now!](#choose-your-book)

Now, accessibility has always been a slightly unsettling realm for web developers. Surrounded with myths, misunderstandings, and contradicting best practices, it used to be a domain for a small group of experts who would "add" accessibility on top of the finished product. Today, in many simple and complex websites, it's still **unclear what makes up an accessible interface** and what developers need to know in order to achieve it.

With our new book, we get to the bottom of it all: accessibility myths and rules of thumb, WAI-ARIA roles, content accessibility guidelines, landmark roles, keyboard and touch accessibility, accessible markup and interaction patterns, accessible forms and widgets, multimedia accessibility and inclusive prototyping. **Everything you need to know about accessibility** gathered in one practical, _smashing_ book, fully dedicated to building and designing accessible user interfaces.

Written by [Heydon Pickering](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/heydon-pickering/), a well-respected accessibility expert, the book includes dozens of practical examples of accessible interface components and inclusive design workflow, applicable to your work right away. With this book, you'll know _exactly_ how to keep interfaces accessible from the very start, and how to design and build inclusive websites without hassle and unnecessary code.

312 pages, quality **hardcover with stitched binding** and a ribbon page marker. Available as a [printed, gorgeous hardcover](https://smashing-magazine.myshopify.com/cart/22870770246:1) and [eBook](https://smashing-magazine.myshopify.com/cart/23316415366:1) today.

## About The Book

Many web design articles and books are all about improving your workflow and making your life easier as a developer. Should you wish to adopt a framework or employ a processor to speed up your development process, be our guest. However, this book is not about you; it's about your _audience_.

The _Inclusive Design Patterns_ book covers all the **techniques, gotchas and front-end strategies** you need to be aware of when building accessible, inclusive interfaces. We'll explore the document outline, external links and "skip" links, navigation regions and landmarks, labelling and alternative text for illustrations, buttons, tables of contents, JavaScript patterns, touch targets, filter widgets and infinite scrolling and tab interfaces and password validation and web forms — and pretty much anything else you need to know about accessibility, including how to prototype with inclusivity in mind, how to deal with legacy browsers and dozens of practical snippets to use when building inclusive interfaces.

What's in it for you? You can take away Heydon's lessons learned and apply them within your framework to allow you to write and organize good interfaces. One thing is certain: once you've read the book, accessibility won't appear difficult nor confusing any longer — you'll know exactly what to do, and when.

### Table Of Contents

You've probably guessed it — the book doesn't deal with theoretical concepts or things that are supposed to work. The book deals with **practical design patterns and common interface components**, and provides ready-to-use code snippets for applying to your work right away.

0. **Introduction**  
We will look at an interactive element, a button, from the perspective of three types of designers. The purpose of this example is to show you how a little bit of knowledge about the medium can lead to a simpler and (therefore) more inclusive solution.

1. **The Document**  
We will look into discrete interface patterns; modules, components, widgets, conventions, whatever-you-want-to-call-thems. It would be foolhardy not to first acknowledge that each will ultimately belong to a web document. HTML pages vary dramatically in shape and size and can include any combination of patterns, but there are a handful of 'document level' best practices to which we should adhere. The aim here is not to go in search of the ultimate 'boilerplate' but to configure a parent web page to support inclusive design.

2. **A Paragraph**  
We'll be looking at typefaces, leading, measure, justification, contrast, focus indication and more, to help you design paragraphs suited for a hugely diverse audience. We'll also tackle specific issues for folks with limited vision, dyslexia, Irlen syndrome, low literacy and limited technical knowledge.

3. **A Blog Post**  
We'll show how to incorporate accessible landmarks and a sound section structure to make the content more navigable and interoperable to a diversity of users and parsers. This will be bolstered by giving well-written and context independent structural as well asand context independent structural and navigational cues.

4. **Navigation**  
We'll progressively enhance HTML's primitives to create the inclusive means to navigate within and between web pages. We will also cover design provisions transferable to many other patterns, including logical source order and the virtue of eliminating redundancy. We will also tackle how to progressively enhance the navigation with JavaScript.

5. **A Menu Button**  
In this chapter, we'll ensure our menu button and the content it reveals are inclusive of differing user settings, circumstances, devices, and assistive technology software.

6. **Inclusive Prototyping**  
By going straight from paper to HTML, we lay the foundations for efficient code and inclusive experiences.

7. **A List Of Products**  
In this chapter, we'll practice our inclusive design chops. As in previous patterns, the organization and structure of content is paramount. We'll look deeply into image accessibility, from both the perspectives of alternative text composition and performance. In catering to blind consumers, to those who cannot afford generous data contracts, and anyone accessing your content from outside your interface, this is a chance to really push the limits of inclusive design.

8. **A Filter Widget**  
We'll explore the importance of giving users choice and control over how their content is arranged. We'll also use some techniques to make sure our design was tolerant of dynamic and fluctuating content. Inclusive design also means a visual design which is not too strict about the nature of the content imparted to it.

9. **A Registration Form**  
This chapter will give you everything you need to develop inclusive forms. By using standard form elements, effective labeling and facilitating the correction of errors, users of all walks are able to access and contribute to your websites and apps. By keeping the form simple and avoiding irritating experiences like disappearing labels and passwords that you cannot check, we've made sure using the form isn't just possible but pleasurable.

10. **Test-driven Markup**  
Test-driven development allows developers working with frequent iterations to move forward with confidence. By writing tests first, to prescribe outcomes, then creating the functionality to achieve them, you can ensure successful builds behave in a predictable and reliable fashion.
