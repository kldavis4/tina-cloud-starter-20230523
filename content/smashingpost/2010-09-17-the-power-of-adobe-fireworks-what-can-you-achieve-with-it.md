Our recent article covering the <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/05/22/adobe-fireworks-is-it-worth-switching-to-cs5/">new features of Adobe Fireworks CS5</a> provoked a very interesting and intense debate. But because comments ranged from "Fireworks is the best tool for screen design!" to "What exactly is Fireworks?", we thought that another article on this topic might be very useful to Smashing Magazine readers.

However, this time the article will not focus so much on the <em>tool itself</em>, but rather on <em>what can be achieved</em> with it, and more specifically — what can be achieved with its <strong>visual/graphic design capabilities</strong>. We also hope that the following showcase of inspiring illustrations, created entirely in Fireworks, will not only be interesting to our readers, but will also help put an end to the common misconception that Fireworks is mostly a prototyping tool – and – that for "serious" design you must switch to other tools, namely Photoshop or Illustrator.</p>

## ...What Exactly Is Fireworks?

Finding the answer to this question is not so easy. Is it a prototyping or wireframing tool? Or is it a powerful graphics editor? Is it a Photoshop competitor, but for Web design only? Is it none of these, or all of the above?

Perhaps presenting you with a quick overview of some of the key features of Fireworks will help you decide the answer to that question yourself.</p>

### What is it?

Fireworks is a bitmap and vector graphics editor formerly developed by Macromedia and since 2006 developed by Adobe. The main purpose of Adobe Fireworks is for creating expressive, highly optimized graphics for Web, screen and various devices

<em>It should be noted that because of its main purpose, Fireworks has certain limitations: it supports only RGB/RGBa colors and the maximum canvas size of its files is approximately 10,000x10,000 pixels</em>.</p>

### What is it good for?

With Fireworks you can make websites, user interfaces and rich Internet application (RIA) interfaces which are editable in both vector and bitmap modes. Fireworks has Pages/Master Pages, Layers, States and Symbols – all features that considerably speed up development of Web designs. You can also use it to create wireframes and interactive prototypes — you can apply behaviors to objects to simulate interactivity; you can add text, symbols, images and also import Illustrator and Photoshop assets; and once ready with the design you can export the files as clickable PDF mock-ups for approval.

Fireworks can turn a graphic design project instantly into an <strong>interactive Web prototype</strong> — simply export a Fireworks single-page or multi-page PNG file as <a href="https://www.adobe.com/devnet/fireworks/articles/fireworks_web_design_css.html">HTML, CSS and images</a>. You can then send such an interactive prototype to a client for approval; or you can further edit the exported code (which is almost <a href="https://www.adobe.com/devnet/fireworks/articles/standards_compliant_design.html">standards compliant</a> and uses an external style sheet) in Dreamweaver, Coda or any other code editor of your choice.</p>

### Export features

Fireworks can export to JPG, GIF/GIF-animated, PNG8/24/32, TIFF and a variety of other graphic formats. The Fireworks compression algorithms are on par with, or <a title="Fireworks and Photoshop compression comparison" href="https://www.webdesignerwall.com/general/fireworks-vs-photoshop-compression/">even better</a> than, Photoshop's. Not only this but Fireworks can also export graphics directly to <strong>PNG8 alpha+index</strong> transparency format with true cross-browser compatibility (this means the exported PNG files will display correctly even in Internet Explorer 6 and 7). This is one of the areas where Fireworks excels and <a href="https://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/2010/08/do-you-care-about-png-8-with-transparency.html">Photoshop still lags behind</a>. Fireworks also shows excellent compression options for <a href="https://www.craftymind.com/2010/09/01/png-compression-on-iphoneipad/">the iPad and iPhone</a> PNG formats.

You can also export Fireworks PNG files as Adobe AIR application prototypes or FXG 2.0 files for development in Flash Catalyst and Flash Builder (FXG 2.0 also allows a much better integration with Illustrator and Photoshop). You can create skin components such as buttons, menu types and form elements for use in Flash Builder <em>(previously known as Adobe Flex Builder)</em>.

### Formats support

Because the native file format of Fireworks is editable PNG <em>(it simply stores additional metadata for layers, animation, vector data, text, effects)</em> and Fireworks is primarily a vector application, <a href="https://www.adobe.com/devnet/fireworks/articles/prototype_iphone_app.html">development for the iPhone</a> is easy and effective in Fireworks. There exist a variety of <a title="Download Fireworks Yahoo stencil kit for iPhone and other mobile phones development" href="https://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/about/stencils/fireworks.html">toolkits</a> and <a title="Download iPhone GUI as Rich Symbols library for Fireworks" href="https://jcorrea.es/2008/08/07/iphone-gui-as-rich-symbols-for-fireworks/">rich symbol libraries</a> for Fireworks iPhone development and they can speed up your work measurably.

Fireworks can open/import native Photoshop (.psd) and Illustrator (.ai) files with high fidelity of layers, effects and blend modes; you can also import native <strong>Adobe Flash</strong> vector objects <em>(you may first need to convert them to .ai, though)</em>. And from Fireworks you can readily transfer graphic assets back to Illustrator and Photoshop. You can also take your design into Adobe Flash Professional and preserve layer states and symbols for animation interactivity development.</p>

### Highly extensible

Fireworks is also <a href="https://help.adobe.com/en_US/fireworks/cs/extend/">highly extensible</a> — this makes possible the developing of amazing extensions <em>(such as <a href="https://johndunning.com/fireworks/about/TweetFire">TweetFire</a>, which lets you instantly tweet the image/design you're currently working on without leaving Fireworks)</em>, complex panels, commands and auto shapes.</p>

## The Showcase Of Fireworks Illustrations

So now that we know what Fireworks is capable of, let's see what designers across the globe are actually <em>doing</em> with it!

The following selection of vector illustrations, logo and icon designs – created in Fireworks – is limited to 19 designers. To make the most of this article, we have made available some Fireworks editable PNG files <em>(.fw.png)</em> which you are welcome to download and deconstruct.</p>

## 2\. Matthew Inman

Matthew is a designer and illustrator who runs the highly successful comics, <a href="https://theoatmeal.com/comics">The Oatmeal</a>. He lives in Seattle, Washington, and uses Adobe Fireworks to draw <a title="Read the full interview with Matthew, where he speaks about The Oatmeal and Fireworks" href="https://keepinspiring.me/2010/01/interview-with-matthew-inman/">all the comic strips</a> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110810065019/https://keepinspiring.me/2010/01/interview-with-matthew-inman/">https://web.archive.org/web/20110810065019/https://keepinspiring.me/2010/01/interview-with-matthew-inman/</a>).
<blockquote>Fireworks is intended for web design, but it’s also a very capable vector editing tool and it works beautifully if your work is going to end up on a website. ...I don’t use Photoshop and I’m actually pretty terrible with it. I also have Illustrator and I was using it for a few months, but I ended up going back to Fireworks simply because I'm more comfortable with it and it's better for creating web content.</blockquote>

Following here is a very short selection of only 5 comic strips — all made with Fireworks (but of course you're welcome to explore the full <a href="https://theoatmeal.com/comics">Oatmeal collection</a>):

## 3\. Ryan Hicks

Did you ever wonder what happens behind the closed doors of Adobe? How <em>their</em> design teams are working? What applications are creating the icons and splash screens of the various Adobe apps? Ryan could tell us a lot about this subject, since he's currently working at Adobe as Design Manager, and prior to that he was Senior Experience Designer at Adobe and Experience Designer at Macromedia. His list of clients also include Polygram Music, <a href="https://www.wired.com/">Wired Magazine</a> and many others <em>(see Ryan's <a href="https://rhworks.com/">portfolio</a>)</em>.

Let's take a look at some of his design and illustration work.</p>

### {08} XD Brownbag Poster series

<a title="View the illustration in large size" href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8e37292e-40c7-4eb7-ab94-84c7d247737b/xd-fwcs3-poster.fullsize"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/055509f4-bdfb-4d24-b59f-1a0e913cbda8/xd-fwcs3-poster.th" alt="Ryan Hicks illustration (Fireworks) width=" height="375" /></a>

After posting it to the Adobe Developer Connection | Fireworks website, Ryan shared the following about this illustration:
<blockquote>This illustration is just one example of a series from the <em>XD Brownbag</em> seminars at Adobe (XD is the Experience Design team at Adobe). The poster art is drawn up at screen resolution and later scaled, because this enables me to build up the shapes more quickly and get into the "drawing light," which is where the real magic of Fireworks comes in. Its incredibly <strong>intuitive gradient opacity controls</strong> and the <strong>Ellipse gradient's multi-handle directional controls</strong> allow a drawing approach that mimics the real behavior of light. Solid objects have a primary base color and separate slices of cast light, bright highlights, and shadows to build up volume and surface.

After the illustration is completed, it is scaled up to print resolution in Fireworks (eat a snack during this process, as big resolutions is one thing Fireworks isn't entirely happy with). This large Fireworks PNG illustration is then taken through Adobe Photoshop to output a transparent PSD, and finally into Adobe Illustrator for layout, typography, and output for the final, print-resolution 24" x 36" poster.</blockquote>

## 5\. Xiao Cai

Xiao currently lives and works in Melbourne, Australia. He's currently building his portfolio and preparing for the <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/">RMIT University</a>. He does not have a personal website but you can check his profile in <a href="https://novelekehe.deviantart.com/">deviantart</a> where he posts some of his works.

Xiao shared with me a bit more details concerning his very interesting technique, which he uses in Adobe Fireworks:
<blockquote>During my free time, I looked through a lot of online tutorials on the use of software like Fireworks, Photoshop and 3DS Max. It is quite amazing that you can learn pretty much anything yourself as long as you put theory and practice together. At the beginning, I created a few simple wallpapers using Fireworks, to get familiar with its tools and options. Then I read an article about creating Chinese painting-like pictures in Adobe Fireworks. I tried a few times and then came up with a style of my own, something like <em>Digital Chinese Painting</em>, and was quite happy with the results. Since then I went deeper and deeper with <em>Gongbi</em> (a meticulously detailed painting style) and <em>Shuimo</em> (a water color style) paintings and re-created them with Fireworks. I was trying different tools and effects to get the right one, then compared these pictures with real Chinese painting reference photos and modified them, until I was satisfied with the end result.

Sometimes, I am also using Fireworks to create icons and other design elements.</blockquote>

Next, you'll see four of Xiao's digital drwaings, each one has a short description added by the author.</p>

Jon Hicks (<a title="Personal website" href="https://hicksdesign.co.uk/">hicksdesign.co.uk</a>, <a title="Twitter profile" href="https://twitter.com/hicksdesign">@hicksdesign</a>) is a designer we need not introduce. Among other things, he is the maker of the Firefox, Thunderbird &amp; Mailchimp logos and lately he was Senior Designer at <a href="https://www.opera.com">Opera Software</a>, before returning to freelance work this year.</p>

### {22} Mozilla Firefox logo

The logo of Mozilla Firefox, one of the leading modern Web browsers, was <a href="https://hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/branding-firefox">originally created in Macromedia Fireworks</a> in 2004. <em>(Note: Later Jon Hicks <a title="Mozilla Firefox logo (Illustrator version)" href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/21c3bd8b-5a32-4143-8048-5a9ea37b7911/firefox-logo-in-illustrator.fullsize">re-created</a> the logo also in Adobe Illustrator, so that it could be transferred to print more easily).</em>

Currently, Jon Hicks admits that he both <a href="https://hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/a-big-assed-post-about-fireworks">loves and hates Fireworks</a>, one of the reasons for which was apparently Fireworks version CS4, which initially proved to be very unstable on MacOS X and Adobe were quite slow to release <a href="https://www.adobe.com/support/fireworks/downloads_updaters.html">two stability patches</a> for it.

When I e-mailed Jon a couple of days ago, he was kind enough to share the following with me:
<blockquote>Apart from the first version of the Mozilla Firefox logo, I do all my illustrations in Adobe Illustrator, rather than Adobe Fireworks. I would often use Fireworks for small icons and mocking up site designs, but anything larger and more complicated would be done in Illustrator. The next higher res [resolution] version of the Firefox logo was created in Illustrator — that's not to say it's impossible in Fireworks, but I find Illustrator easier for that kind of thing, and it's then simple to create high res CMYK versions for print, as well as screen.</blockquote>

<span class="removed_link" title="https://www.vart.io">Mikko Vartio</span> is a visual web designer from Helsinki, Finland. He uses Adobe Fireworks as a primary tool for creating websites, illustrations, for UI Design and wireframing. When he's not working with Fireworks he's reading old sci-fi books and cruising the streets with a longboard.

For Mikko, Fireworks is the perfect tool for delivering ideas destined for screen because of its extensibility, native .ai/.psd support and pixel-perfect accuracy.

The Adobe CS5 Branding work was conceived and executed by Ryan Hicks (lead), Shawn Cheris and Dave Nelson. There's a very interesting <a href="https://veerle-v2.duoh.com/blog/comments/the_new_cs5_branding/">article at Veerle Pieters's blog</a> dedicated to the "making of". I highly recommend reading this as well as <a href="https://rhworks.com/archives/2010/04/cs5-desktop-brand.html">Ryan's thoughts</a> on the matter too:
<blockquote>Producing assets for nearly a hundred separate software products takes enormous discipline. Discipline in what a few people can commit to executing in terms of fancy design, and discipline in coordinating and scheduling a hundred separate engineering development cycles and their deadlines. And to keep things interesting, Dave bails just before our production schedule was set to kick off. Shawn and I are now an army of two.

Our survival was dependent on the carefully-hewn master files we created for all the hand-built primary assets such as app icons and splash screens. The files leveraged clever layer structures and the attributes management <strong>Adobe Fireworks does best</strong>.

We have become, in so many words, an outrageously efficient icon factory, pumped up on caffeine, razor sharp pixels, and a couple AIR apps.

CS5 is my third iteration of Adobe's product identity system. The project was one of the most enjoyable and satisfying I've had in my nearly seven years of working at Macromedia/Adobe.</blockquote>

All splash screens and many of the icons of the CS5 apps were made in Fireworks — and most of them exist in various formats including .fw.png and .ai.</p>

## So, how good is Fireworks for Web design?

Fireworks is a solid application for creating Web graphics and as <a href="https://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/2010/09/feedback-please-potential-webdrawing-features-in-photoshop.html">John Nack</a> from Adobe Photoshop team says: "Photoshop’s vector shapes &amp; layer effects (strokes, gradients, etc.) are mainstays of Web &amp; mobile design work, but they haven’t gotten updated in a while. If the Photoshop team were to improve this area of the app, what improvements would you find the most important?"

John then lists all features that could probably be added to the next version of Photoshop (CS6?). Let's take a look at his list — I have marked the features that are proposed to be included in the <em>next</em> version of Photoshop but already exist in <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/fireworks/">Adobe Fireworks</a> (version CS5 or even lower) in <em>italics</em>.

1.  _Enable "real" vector shapes_ (stroke & fill _directly editable_, without reliance on layer effects or a dialog box).
2.  Support _dashed—_ and _dotted—_line strokes.
3.  Enable smart shapes — _preserve corner roundness_ when scaling rounded rectangles; support _other parameterized shapes_ (e.g. stars with an _adjustable number of points_; lines _with arrowheads_).
4.  Make various layer effects enhancements — _apply effects at the layer group level_?; _re-order effects_; duplicate effects (e.g. _apply multiple strokes per layer_); enable _panel-based editing of effects_ (instead of relying on a dialog box); _add/edit effects on multiple selected layers_ at once; make graphical styles “live” (i.e. _if edit the style definition, all styled objects update_).
5.  Enable layer search (i.e. type to filter by layer name or attributes).
6.  Improve _snap-to-pixel behavior_.
7.  _Improve text rendering_ _(this is possible in Fireworks with the [ClearType Styles](https://www.idux.com/2009/11/26/simulate-cleartype-text-in-adobe-fireworks-cs4/) extension)_.
8.  Export _text & graphical styles as CSS_* _(this is already partially possible in Fireworks – it can export a Web graphic design as HTML/CSS code and also can quickly "translate" some objects' properties into CSS via extensions such as "Copy CSS Dimensions to Clipboard")_.
9.  _Support guide sets_ (e.g. for grid layouts).
10.  Support linked files (i.e. edit one file to update buttons, icons, etc. across multiple PSDs).

As can be seen, almost all future features for Photoshop proposed by John Nack are actually existing features in Fireworks and are used by many designers today. It'll be certainly interesting to keep tabs on how Adobe develops both Photoshop and Fireworks in the future – and what designers will then achieve.</p>

## Conclusion

Adobe Fireworks is a powerful graphic design application that is used by many professional Web and graphic designers, UX designers, illustrators and visual artists. In the right hands, it can produce beautiful results with remarkable speed. You have seen some complex vector designs, various drawing techniques, logos and icons and simply cool illustrations.

Perhaps what is the nicest thing about Fireworks is that if you plan to create artwork in Fireworks, your project development is not limited to Fireworks only. You can easily import multi-layered .psd files, .ai files with multiple artboards and even visual assets from Flash. And then in the other direction, from Fireworks, you can transfer graphic assets to Photoshop, Illustrator, Flash Professional and Flash Catalyst. You can combine the Fireworks speed, vector power, Pages/Master Pages, Symbols and ease-of-use together with the options of both Photoshop and Illustrator and achieve all-round results, faster and with great flexibility.

In my personal opinion, there exists much more than <a href="https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2010/08/7-reasons-why-i-choose-fireworks-over-photoshop/">7 reasons to prefer Fireworks to Photoshop</a>. While Fireworks may be not <a href="https://www.isfireworksbetterthanphotoshop.com/">better than Photoshop</a>, when it comes to designing for the Web and screen, it is faster, easier and can produce results as good as those that can be achieved in Photoshop, Illustrator, and other modern graphic design programs. Fireworks is very close to the <a href="https://jasonsantamaria.com/articles/a-real-web-design-application/">real Web design application</a> that Jason Santa Maria was discussing not long ago <em>(although for this to happen, Fireworks would need much more intensive development from the part of Adobe)</em>.</p>

### {62} Adobe Photoshop CS5 splash screen

And there you have our final illustration. Next time you start Photoshop CS5, you may ponder that the "blue fish" splash screen you see was actually created in Fireworks — the lightweight, versatile design application that is responsible for most of the artwork across the Adobe CS5 suite.

If you think that I may have missed someone's truly great (Fireworks) work, please let us know in the comments, thanks!
