## 2\. iPhone CSS Techniques

iPhone has revolutionized the way many people view the Web. Mobile web browsers before that were often clunky and were primarily used for quickly looking things up online, not for general browsing. But now, the iPhone and similar new mobiles devices make browsing online while on the go much easier. It makes sense to design with the iPhone in mind now. Below are some resources for creating CSS specifically for the iPhone.

<a href="https://flyosity.com/application-design/iphone-application-design-patterns.php">iPhone Application UI Design Patterns</a>
The iPhone is one big constraint — no keyboard, small screen, few buttons — so designing applications for the iPhone is an exercise in building smart, simple software. There are three main interaction concepts that correspond to three different types of View Controllers: Navigation Controllers, Tab Bar Controllers, Modal View Controllers and Table View Controllers respectfully. These are the building blocks for crafting iPhone applications.
