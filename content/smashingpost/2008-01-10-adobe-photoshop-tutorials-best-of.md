  When it comes to graphic design, **Adobe Photoshop** is usually the first
  option to consider. However, the software itself is a quite tough nut to crack
  — and definitely extremely hard to master. For instance, the concepts are not
  always intuitive and it’s not always clear when to use what tool and how to
  use it effectively. In fact, in Photoshop it usually takes pretty much time to
  achieve something you have never done before.

  However, you don’t need to muddle through numerous Photoshop features and
  extensions for every design problem. You can use professional suggestions
  instead, e.g. professional **step-by-step tutorials** which provide excellent
  results and thus can save you a lot of time.

When it comes to graphic design, <strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong> is usually the first option to consider. However, the software itself is a quite tough nut to crack — and definitely extremely hard to master. For instance, the concepts are not always intuitive and it’s not always clear when to use what tool and how to use it effectively. In fact, in Photoshop it usually takes pretty much time to achieve something you have never done before.

However, you don’t need to muddle through numerous Photoshop features and extensions for every design problem. You can use professional suggestions instead, e.g. professional <strong>step-by-step tutorials</strong> which provide excellent results and thus can save you a lot of time.

One year ago we’ve presented a hand-picked <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/01/hand-picked-photoshop-tutorials/">collection of Photoshop tutorials</a>. Now it’s time for a fresh portion of healthy Photoshop learning material. This article provides <strong>professional Adobe Photoshop tutorials</strong> which can enrich your design skills and improve the quality of your works. Although the authors of the tutorials rarely provide the information about the used version, we tried to pick only those tutorials that can be used with both CS 3 and older versions of Adobe Photoshop.</p>
