(This is a sponsored article.) The modern web is very unified. Designers use the same patterns, and, as a result, websites created by different people look like clones. The only way to stand out from the crowd is via content. Content is what brings people to your website in the first place.

[Tilda is a website builder](https://tilda.cc/?utm_source=smashingmagazine&utm_term=tildatop) that can be used to create websites, landing pages, online stores and special projects. Tilda’s creators practice a “content-first” philosophy: Content precedes design. Being big fans of storytelling, they came up with block mechanics for creating websites, so that users not just create web pages, but also tell stories about their products or services. And it helps to turn visitors to customers more effectively.

This article is a story of how Tilda differs from other website builders and how it helps you focus on what you know and love, without having to think about technical stuff &mdash; because you often don’t have time to learn technical things. Below are a few key benefits of using Tilda to create websites.

<figure class="video-container"><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mg4N54ymAf4" width="600" height="480" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>

## Blocks Mechanics

When designers make websites, they often have to implement the same objects over and over again. This not only makes the design process tedious, but also takes up valuable time.

To solve this problem, the Tilda team created blocks, which are commonly used modules. This modular editing mechanism is at the core of the platform. When you create a website, you don't need to use a hardcoded template; all you need to do is choose predesigned blocks that satisfy your requirements.

You have access to a library of 450 blocks. This library is updated constantly. To facilitate navigation between blocks, Tilda organizes them into categories. Each block in a collection is categorized either by function (for example, cover) or by meaning (for example, product reviews, “our team”, etc.).

<figure><a href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0acd61b4-07d6-48ed-991f-4d7bc0ad3c7a/24-tilda-website-builder.gif"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0acd61b4-07d6-48ed-991f-4d7bc0ad3c7a/24-tilda-website-builder.gif" width="615" height="370" alt="A collection of 450+ blocks to suit almost any kind of content." /></a><figcaption>A collection of 450+ blocks to suit almost any kind of content. (<a href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0acd61b4-07d6-48ed-991f-4d7bc0ad3c7a/24-tilda-website-builder.gif">Large preview</a>)</figcaption></figure>

All blocks have been created by professional designers, so you don’t need to worry about the core design properties. Also, all blocks work harmoniously together, so you don’t need to worry about how to adjust one block to another.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/855ecd69-4896-4ea1-98c9-d8a02e08f10c/tilda-website-builder-29-large.png" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/855ecd69-4896-4ea1-98c9-d8a02e08f10c/tilda-website-builder-29-large.png" sizes="100vw" caption="Tilda block library (<a href='https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/855ecd69-4896-4ea1-98c9-d8a02e08f10c/tilda-website-builder-29-large.png'>Large preview</a>)" alt="Tilda block library" >}}

You might be thinking, “Does this mean that all websites created using blocks will look like clones?” No. Think of a block as a skeleton: It gives you something to modify according to your own needs. Tilda gives you a lot of control over the details. Almost everything in a block is adjustable.

Tilda allows you to customize blocks using the content and settings areas. Click on the “Content” button to edit all of the information that a block contains. The “Settings” button allows you to adjust different parameters, such as the visual appearance of a block. If you want to change the text, click on it and change it directly on the screen. To replace a picture, simply drag it from the folder on your computer.

<figure><a href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/249ce47c-d9c7-49eb-afed-18ba01224ee4/tilda-website-builder-5.gif"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/249ce47c-d9c7-49eb-afed-18ba01224ee4/tilda-website-builder-5.gif" width="1000" height="658" alt="" /></a><figcaption>(<a href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/249ce47c-d9c7-49eb-afed-18ba01224ee4/tilda-website-builder-5.gif">Large preview</a>)</figcaption></figure>

The following are the biggest advantages of using blocks:

- **Readability**  
Tilda puts a strong focus on typography. Tilda’s team take care of all typographic elements such as line length, spacing and font sizes to harmonious proportions. Every block is perfectly balanced to make the reading an enjoyable experience.
- **Responsiveness**  
There's no need to spend any time optimizing pages for tablets and smartphones.
- **Visual appearance**  
The appearance of the blocks can be changed dramatically: the sizes of text and images, buttons &mdash; you can do everything on your own on the tab ‘Settings.’
- **Solving complex problems**  
Using blocks, you can solve pretty complex tasks such as collecting applications or selling goods and services.

## Zero Block

No matter how rich a default collection of blocks is, some users will always want to create something truly unique. Precisely for this case, Tilda provides a [Zero Block](https://zero.tilda.cc/?utm_source=smashingmagazine) editor: a built-in editor for creating your own blocks. Think of it as a graphic editor for your website that lets you explore your creativity: add text, shape, button, image, video, tooltip, form, even insert HTML code; move, transform and hide every element on the canvas. You can start from scratch and create new unique blocks!

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7e84bef5-f68a-4d40-b8dc-89600c7b47b5/zero-block-example-large.png" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7e84bef5-f68a-4d40-b8dc-89600c7b47b5/zero-block-example-large.png" sizes="100vw" caption="(<a href='https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7e84bef5-f68a-4d40-b8dc-89600c7b47b5/zero-block-example-large.png'>Large preview</a>)" alt="Zero Block" >}}

All you need to do to start using the editor is to click the “Zero” button on a newly created page. Zero Block allows you to manage every detail of your design. You can change the style options for objects, change their position, change their size and more.

Here is how this process looks:

<figure><a href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/30c6020b-aaed-472f-b749-056a042ae415/tilda-website-builder-26.gif"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/30c6020b-aaed-472f-b749-056a042ae415/tilda-website-builder-26.gif" width="1000" height="637" alt="Using Zero Block it’s possible to turn a promising idea into reality by designing a bespoke block." /></a><figcaption>Using Zero Block it’s possible to turn a promising idea into reality by designing a bespoke block.

Just like regular Blocks, Zero Blocks are adaptive. Tilda provides five modes for adapting content to different screen sizes. You can preview a design in the following screen modes:

- mobile (portrait mode),
- mobile (landscape mode),
- tablet (portrait),
- tablet (landscape mode),
- desktop.

Zero Block can be used together with existing blocks. It’s possible to convert an existing block into a Zero Block and modify it however you like.

## Animated Effects

Animation brings a sense of interactivity to the user experience. Properly incorporated, animation make a website’s elements come alive. There a lot of different ways in which adding motion can benefit users. For example, you can use animation to focus the user's attention on a particular object (such as by assigning a specific animated effect to a call-to-action button to direct the user’s attention to that element) or for purely aesthetic purposes (such as to create a sense of craftsmanship).

Tilda allows you to create stunning interactive pages without any code. Tilda provides three types of animation, which we’ll go over now.

### 1. Basic Animation

In all standard blocks, you can adjust the appearance of any element to make the website more alive and interesting. For example, you can add an animated effect for a cover title.

<figure><a href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/84b07809-0332-45de-9656-3ffd55c6245d/tilda-website-builder-2.gif"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/84b07809-0332-45de-9656-3ffd55c6245d/tilda-website-builder-2.gif" width="1000" height="650" alt="Opacity animated effect" /></a><figcaption>Opacity animated effect (<a href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/84b07809-0332-45de-9656-3ffd55c6245d/tilda-website-builder-2.gif">Large preview</a>)</figcaption></figure>

Animations work in all blocks, except for the slider. All you need to do to add an animated effect is simply select the desired effect in the block settings.

### 2. Extended Animation In Zero Block

With Tilda, you can also create [a step-by-step animation](https://tilda.cc/lp/step-by-step-animation/?utm_source=smashingmagazine) where any element of the page can be a part of motion sequence. Tilda allows you to set the trajectory of elements. You can implement complex behaviors for elements on the page and add maximum interactivity.

<figure><a href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2e3969ca-b603-4254-8957-3f3f6f7aeb46/tilda-website-builder-1.gif"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2e3969ca-b603-4254-8957-3f3f6f7aeb46/tilda-website-builder-1.gif" width="600" height="363" alt="An example of step-by-step animation" /></a><figcaption>An example of step-by-step animation (<a href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2e3969ca-b603-4254-8957-3f3f6f7aeb46/tilda-website-builder-1.gif">Large preview</a>)</figcaption></figure>

In addition to the appearance effects, you can adjust parallax and fixing. Parallax enables objects to move at different speeds when users scroll a page. Fixing allows you to fix an object on the screen during the scroll. You can play with following parameters: speed, duration, delay, event triggers for starting the animation.

<figure><a href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a8ee9f1b-3ac3-4d96-83a9-105003855a47/19-tilda-website-builder.gif"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a8ee9f1b-3ac3-4d96-83a9-105003855a47/19-tilda-website-builder.gif" width="600" height="370" alt="Make elements come alive with animation!" /></a><figcaption>Make elements come alive with animation!</figcaption></figure>

Here is a quick video that demonstrates how to create a complex animated effect.

<figure class="video-container"><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9xev5W_ZmWg" width="600" height="480" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></figure>

### 3. Specially Designed Blocks

Those blocks are designed to add animation effects. You can also create animation using special blocks, such as:

- a typewriter effect,
- a galaxy effect for covers,
- an animated slideshow for covers

## Templates

While [templates](https://tilda.cc/tpls/?utm_source=smashingmagazine) and blocks sound pretty similar to each other, they are different. Templates are for common use cases (such as [landing pages](https://tilda.cc/lp/create-landing-page/?utm_source=smashingmagazine) for businesses, event pages, blogs, etc.); they can be used as a base and later changed according to your own style. Choose a template that’s most relevant to your project, and customize it according to your preferences. Unlike many other website builders, Tilda doesn’t force users to select a template from a list. It’s entirely up to you whether to use a template or start with a blank slate.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8b574307-3e5e-4542-9732-218090d1e5d8/2-tilda-website-builder.png" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8b574307-3e5e-4542-9732-218090d1e5d8/2-tilda-website-builder.png" sizes="100vw" caption="Tilda provides ready-made templates for landing pages, online stores, etc. Save time by using predesigned store templates.

It’s also possible to design your own template. All you need to do is design your own page and save it as a template. You can share the template with others.

## SEO Optimization

<p>The web has <a href="https://www.millforbusiness.com/how-many-websites-are-there/">over 1 billion websites</a> and is continually growing. All of those websites are competing for visitors. In today’s competitive market, search engine optimization (SEO) &mdash improving a website's rankings in search results &mdash; is more important than ever, and it’s become a critical task of web designers.</p>

<p>The great news about Tilda is that it’s <a href="https://tilda.cc/lp/seo/">a search-engine-friendly platform</a>; websites created with Tilda are automatically indexed by search engines. A <code>robots.txt</code> file (which contains special instructions for search engine robots) and a <code>sitemap.xml</code> file (which lists the URLs of the website) are generated automatically.</p>

Users can improve search results using special settings:

- You can manage title and description settings and set meta tags for HTML objects (for example, `alt` tags for images).
- Add `h1`, `h2` and `h3` tags. The `h1` heading carries the most weight for search engines.
- Set https or http, www or non-www, and 301 redirects (a 301 redirect improves SEO when you change a URL).

Users have access to Tilda’s “Webmaster Dashboard”. This tool tests a website against basic recommendations from search engines and identifies errors that would affect indexing. The tool is available in “Site Settings” &rarr; “Analytics and SEO” &rarr; “Tilda Webmaster Dashboard”. Users can click “Check Pages” in “Critical Errors and Recommendations” to see which pages need work.

{{< rimg href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/24ee8ce4-2d28-407b-963a-3fec234a58b1/tilda-website-builder-7.png" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/24ee8ce4-2d28-407b-963a-3fec234a58b1/tilda-website-builder-7.png" sizes="100vw" caption="Tilda Webmaster Dashboard, a tool for SEO.

## Fonts

[95% of the information on the web is written language](https://ia.net/topics/the-web-is-all-about-typography-period). As Oliver Reichenstein states in his article “Web Design Is 95% Typography”: Optimizing typography is optimizing readability, accessibility, usability(!), overall graphic balance.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8da85d1d-d0bd-4c3a-8e1c-0b0ae49bef62/28-tilda-website-builder-new.png" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8da85d1d-d0bd-4c3a-8e1c-0b0ae49bef62/28-tilda-website-builder-new.png" sizes="100vw" caption="Geometria font, designed by Gayaneh Bagdasaryan and Vyacheslav Kirilenko, courtesy of <a href='https://rentafont.com/'>Rentafont</a>.

I’ve already mentioned that Tilda has a strong focus on typography, but it is worth saying a few words about the font collection. Fonts have a direct impact on a website’s aesthetics. Tilda users have access to a rich font collection. Tilda integrates with Google Fonts and Typekit. Users can [use distinctive fonts](https://blog-en.tilda.cc/new-fonts/?utm_source=smashingmagazine) such as Futura, Formular, Geometria, Circe, Kazimir and others provided by [Rentafont](https://rentafont.com).

### Data Collection Forms

The primary goal of the business is creating and keeping customers. And one of the main tools that allow business to work with it customers is [forms](https://tilda.cc/lp/forms/?utm_source=smashingmagazine). Forms allow customers to send applications and feedback, or subscribe to mailing list. Using Tilda, you can create vertical, horizontal, pop-up, and step-by-step forms. The library has a separate category with ready-made design options.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7f74cabc-ec44-4447-a8b4-1cf4b066b4d3/tilda-website-builder-24.png" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7f74cabc-ec44-4447-a8b4-1cf4b066b4d3/tilda-website-builder-24.png" sizes="100vw" caption="(<a href='https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7f74cabc-ec44-4447-a8b4-1cf4b066b4d3/tilda-website-builder-24.png'>Large preview</a>)" alt="example of using forms from Tilda block library" >}}

In vertical forms, you can add an unlimited number of fields. For each field you can choose its type: drop-down list, checkbox, phone number, file attachment, etc. Tida provides a few special form fields such as ‘Split’ and ‘Calculator.’ The ‘Split’ field allows you to divide the form into a few steps. The ‘Calculator’ field allows you to calculate the cost using a specific formula and shows the cost to the visitor before sending. This can be extremely useful for e-commerce websites (during product purchase).

Tilda integrates with various data-receiving services. It helps you solve common problems with data collection, such as:

- Connecting emails, Telegram or Slack messengers, Trello or Google Table to quickly proceed new applications.
- **Running email campaigns and collecting email subscribers**  
Set up a form on Tilda and connect it to mailing lists in MailChimp, UniSender, SendGrid or GetResponse.
- **Collecting data about online orders into a CRM system**  
Trello, Pipedrive and AmoCRM are CRM systems that all have native integration with Tilda. All you need to do to start receiving the data is to link up your account.

### Email Campaign Builder

Tilda has a built-in constructor for emails which allows you to create a nice looking email from blocks in no time. You can connect MailChimp, UniSender, SendGrid services and send mail directly from the Tilda interface. If you use other email services, email builder still can be useful for you &mdash; you can download HTML code of a template created in Tilda and use it in your service.

### Built-In Analytics

Tilda has built-in analytics that show basic measurements of a website’s effectiveness: page views, page conversions, visitor engagement, etc. These key performance indicators satisfy the basic needs of users. It’s possible to view high-level details (general performance) and page-specific data.

### Company Website

In the modern world, the first interaction between a customer and business happens online. People visit a website and decide whether they want to do business with that company. Design plays a vital role in the decision. When a website looks fresh and modern, there’s a better chance that people will work with the company. [Quantum Attorneys](https://quantum-attorneys.com/) uses a lot of popular visual effects (vibrant colors, duotones, attention-grabbing typography) to create a truly unique feel for visitors.

### Artwork

<p>People often come to a website for inspiration. Inspiration can come in many forms. But sometimes, a relatively simple design can arouse a lot of emotions. White space is one of the most significant aspects of design. Check out <a href="https://www.buro247.sg/special/silentrebellion/christian-dada-silent-rebellion-tokyo-japan.html">Buro247</a>’s project called Silent Rebellion Fashion.
