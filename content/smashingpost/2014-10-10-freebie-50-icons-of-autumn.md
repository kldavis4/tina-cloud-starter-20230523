  There are icons that you can find quite easily, and icons that are difficult
  to come across. With _Icons of Autumn_, we are humbled to release a set of
  **50 free autumn-themed EPS icons** illustrated in a lovely sketchy style.

  Designed by Nick Botner as line art in Adobe Illustrator, the icons are
  available in EPS, enabling you to change both the color or the weight of the
  strokes with ease. However, if you want to make the icons into solid shapes,
  it shouldn’t take much effort either.

### Insights From The Designer:

<blockquote>"Normally, I shy away from designing seasonal things, but I have a special place in my heart for Autumn. Actually, that’s because I used to live in Florida and always welcomed the “cold”. However, now that I live in the PNW, I guess you could say this might be the last time I love Autumn.

And as far as the set goes, it’s a continuation of icons that I have been slowly creating in this smooth sketch style. Previously I designed a nautical set, a weather set, and a scientific set. Now with Autumn added to the family, I need to think about what comes next."</blockquote>
