If you are an experienced professional, chances are you have a good set of tools and a work process that you repeat on a daily basis to handle your work. That's good; it's how you become more productive, and become an expert. But with repetitive processes come repetitive mechanical work. Whether it's opening a file in Photoshop to change the format or adding an iCal to-do item based on an email you received, these little tasks <strong>can be streamlined</strong>. That's the purpose of AppleScripts.

AppleScript is a scripting language developed by Apple to help people automate their work processes on the Mac operating system. It accomplishes this by exposing every element of the system's applications as an object in an extremely simple, English-like language. AppleScript is to the Mac OS as JavaScript is to browsers.

## First, Where To Put Your AppleScripts

After you download a script, you have to know where to put it to start using it. For this purpose, let's say that there are <strong>three different kinds of AppleScripts</strong>, each of which is used for a different purpose.</p>

### Simple Scripts

You put these scripts in a special folder and call them when you need them. You can invoke them just by double clicking on them, but calling them contextually is a lot more effective. Using the <strong>Script Menu</strong> is one way to achieve this.

To activate the Script Menu, first open the <strong>AppleScript Utility</strong> app in the <em>/Applications/AppleScript</em> folder and check "Show Script Menu in menu bar."

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/9e18c4bf-517d-4721-957c-73014de07e8c/script-utilities.jpg" alt="AppleScript Utility screenshot" />

The Script Menu will show a list of AppleScripts that come with Mac OS X, plus your application-specific scripts. To add a script to an application, simply put it in <em>~/Library/Scripts/Applications/&lt;NAME_OF_THE_APPLICATION&gt;</em>. If that folder doesn't exist, you can create it.

For example, if you had a Safari AppleScript, you'd put it in <em>~/Library/Scripts/Applications/Safari</em>. From then on, if you clicked the Script Menu when Safari was active, your script would appear at the top of the list for you to use.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/3b34b1a3-cb42-46d1-bf3b-72804c77e795/contextual-script-menu.jpg" alt="Simple Script screenshot" />

### Droplets

Droplets are AppleScripts that live in the Finder's toolbar. To use it, all you need to do is drop a file or folder into it. This is very useful for when a script affects a file or the contents of a folder, because all you have to do is drop the target of the action onto the script's icon.

To "install" a Droplet, first save it in a folder of your choosing: <em>~/Library/Scripts/Droplets</em> is a good place. Then just drag the script to the Finder's toolbar.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/b72306eb-7c2a-407b-83ca-8256dcac6316/finders-toolbar.jpg" alt="Droplet Screenshot" />

### Folder Actions

Folder Actions are AppleScripts that are "attached" to a folder. They are executed every time you perform an action with that folder. Folder Actions can get triggered every time you add a file to a folder, remove a file, modify its items, etc. The behavior depends on how the script works, but you can imagine how useful that would be.

To add a Folder Action to a folder, right-click it to bring up the contextual menu, and click <em>Attach a Folder Action</em>. The default location for Folder Action scripts is <em>/Library/Scripts/Folder Action Scripts</em>, but if you want to keep all your custom-installed scripts in one place, <em>~/Library/Scripts/Folder Actions</em> is a good place to keep them.

## Multimedia Processing

### 1. ConvertImage

### 2. QuickTime to Photoshop

Exports QuickTime frames directly to Photoshop. All you have to do is pause a video at the frame that you want to export, and then invoke the script. If Photoshop is closed, the script will activate it for you. After it imports the frame, it will ask you if you want another frame from the QuickTime file.

## Mail And iCal

### 10. Fuhgeddaboutit

In Sopranos-speak, fuhgeddaboutit means "forget about it." Indeed, one of the purposes of GTD is to free your brain from having to keep track of everything. Just relax, forget about it now and be confident that you'll remember when you need to.

This script make that possible by making iCal To-Do items from an Apple Mail email. Just invoke the script with the email you want, and it will create an iCal item with a due time set relative to the email's arrival.

### 12\. Remove iCal Duplicates

When you sync and share many calendars in iCal, you often end up with a lot of duplicates. This simple script helps you remove those. But once you ask it to delete duplicates, there's no undoing. So, be sure to back up your calendar first.

Remove iCal Duplicates
<strong>Type:</strong> Simple Script
<strong>Requirements:</strong> None

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/05b65b02-88ab-4d1d-8bf4-c60964f1b766/ical-duplicates1.jpg" alt="Remove iCal Duplicates on which calendar to choose" />

## Finder Utilities

### 14\. Pack'em

Pack'em takes one or more items from Finder, packs them with tar, compresses them with either bzip2 or gzip and saves the compressed archive in the same folder as the original items. A great companion to the Send Attachment Droplet. With these two AppleScripts, you can compress and email a set of files or folders directly from Finder.

Pack'em
<strong>Type:</strong> Simple Script
<strong>Requirements:</strong> None

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/b4826116-2908-4339-a220-fc1048b36a62/packem1.jpg" alt="Pack'em screenshot on choosing the compression format" />

### 15\. Rename Files

Just drop a folder into this Droplet, and it will give you a lot of options to batch process its contents. You can rename the files according to names specified in a particular text file or change the files individually. Either way accomplishes your task much faster than by changing every file name independently.

Rename Files
<strong>Type:</strong> Droplet
<strong>Requirements:</strong> None

### 16\. Websafe Name

If you develop websites, you are probably accustomed to giving your files Web-friendly names. But there are times when you have to upload a whole set of files sent to you by a client, or upload things that you weren't expecting to use. Websafe Name is very useful for this kind of task. You don't even need to look through the list of files; just drop them into this script, and it will rename them to something Web-friendly.

Websafe Name
<strong>Type:</strong> Droplet
<strong>Requirements:</strong> None

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c0509e9b-8386-4f3a-8a23-e7ee6e93b795/web-safe1.jpg" alt="Web safe name screenshot on dropping" />

## Finder Utilities

### 14\. Pack'em

Pack'em takes one or more items from Finder, packs them with tar, compresses them with either bzip2 or gzip and saves the compressed archive in the same folder as the original items. A great companion to the Send Attachment Droplet. With these two AppleScripts, you can compress and email a set of files or folders directly from Finder.

### 15\. Rename Files

Just drop a folder into this Droplet, and it will give you a lot of options to batch process its contents. You can rename the files according to names specified in a particular text file or change the files individually. Either way accomplishes your task much faster than by changing every file name independently.

### 16\. Websafe Name

If you develop websites, you are probably accustomed to giving your files Web-friendly names. But there are times when you have to upload a whole set of files sent to you by a client, or upload things that you weren't expecting to use. Websafe Name is very useful for this kind of task. You don't even need to look through the list of files; just drop them into this script, and it will rename them to something Web-friendly.

### 17\. Tagger

The "folder" is a computer interface paradigm that is a very powerful way to organize files. But it's neither the only paradigm nor the best solution for all scenarios. Many sub-folders nested deep is a sign that a folder structure may not be appropriate. Another great paradigm, coming straight from the Web, is "tagging." You keep all your files flat in a common location, but group them by tags so that you can retrieve or filter them by tags. It so happens that the Mac OS X has very good support for this. You can use Spotlight Comments to tag files and Smart Folders to dynamically retrieve them. All you need now is an easy way to do this, and this Folder Action does exactly that.

To use Tagger, attach it to a folder. Then, every time you add a file to that folder via Finder, the script will prompt you to tag that file. It also automatically creates Smart Folders for all of your defined tags.
