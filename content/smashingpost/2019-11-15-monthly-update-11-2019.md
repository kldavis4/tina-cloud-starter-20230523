## What’s New At Smashing?

The last SmashingConf of this year took place in New York, an event that got sold out a long way in advance and another one we’re all quite proud of. In case you missed out, our editor-in-chief Rachel Andrew summed up everything in a post with [videos and photos of SmashingConf NY](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/11/smashingconf-ny-2019/). You can find the slides of the talks over [here](https://smashingconf.com/ny-2019/), and even already [grab your super early-bird ticket](https://smashingconf.com/ny-2020/registration) if you like!

## Best Picks From Our Newsletter

We’ll be honest: Every second week, we struggle with keeping the Smashing Newsletter issues at a moderate length &mdash; there are just so many talented folks out there working on brilliant projects! So, without wanting to make this monthly update too long either, we’re shining the spotlight on the following projects:

**Note**: *A thank you to [Cosima Mielke](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/cosima-mielke/) for writing and preparing these posts!*

### Free Services For Developers

<p>So many services out there offer free tiers, but they can be hard to find. <a href="https://free-for.dev/#/">Free For Developers</a> wants to change that and lists software and other services that have free tiers for developers.</p>

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://free-for.dev/#/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e5b68be6-955f-48b2-9c60-2f4aa605e1f6/free-for-dev-large-preview.png" sizes="100vw" caption="<a href='https://free-for.dev/#/'>free-for.dev</a>, a list of SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings that have free tiers of interest to devops and infradev." alt="Free for developers" >}}

<p>The services included in the list are particularly interesting for System Administrators, DevOps Practitioners, and other infrastructure developers and cover everything from cloud providers and source code repos to testing, log management, payment integration, and a lot more. More than 500 people have contributed to this community project and you are welcome to submit your findings, too, of course. A handy resource for the bookmarks. </p>

### Git Command Cheatsheet

<p>Do you know your git commands? While you probably know the most common ones by heart, there are always those commands that are easily forgotten because you don’t need them often. A concise refresher now comes from Rainer Selvet.</p>

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://gitsheet.wtf/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e6aa0e67-f809-4da5-a525-74aca501c07a/gitsheet-wtf-large-preview.png" sizes="100vw" caption="<a href='https://gitsheet.wtf/'>GitSheet</a>, a dead simple git cheatsheet." alt="A list of git commands and what they do" >}}

<p>Described as a “dead simple git cheatsheet” by its creator, <a href="https://gitsheet.wtf/">GitSheet</a> lists git commands and what they do by topic. A nifty little feature: You can copy a command to your clipboard with just a click. Simple yet effective. </p>

### A Playground For Tinkering With Design Systems

<p>You’re about to build a design system but don’t really know where or how to begin? Well, the <a href="https://design-system-playground.netlify.com/">Design System Playground</a> might be a great place to get started.</p>

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://design-system-playground.netlify.com/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ff30a4ff-0709-42cb-b513-14cf862e4710/design-system-playground-large-preview.png" sizes="100vw" caption="<a href='https://design-system-playground.netlify.com/'>Design System Playground</a>, an open-source project built by <a href='https://twitter.com/johnpolacek/'>John Polacek</a>." alt="Choosing a body font on the Design System Playground" >}}

<p>The playground offers a lot of room to tinker with different font and color combinations and, once you’re happy with your choices, it generates a design system that you can export and use in your projects right away. If the visual direction of your design isn’t clear yet, there’s also the option to use a preset theme or random choices to build upon. </p>

### Freebie: Mix-And-Match Illustrations

<p>Illustrations are a fantastic way to breathe some life into a project. But not all of us have the skills to create them ourselves or the time or the budget to hire an illustrator. For these occasions, the mix-and-match illustration library which Leni Kauffman created, might come in handy.</p>

<figure><a href="https://fresh-folk.com/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f110c43e-3b32-4849-8a19-ae62ba15d4c0/fresh-folks-examples.gif" alt="Illustrations of people interacting to each other" /></a><figcaption><a href="https://fresh-folk.com/">Fresh Folk</a>, a beautiful illustration library of
people and objects created and designed by London-based illustrator <a href='https://twitter.com/lenikauffman'>Leni Kauffman</a>.</figcaption></figure>

<p><a href="https://fresh-folk.com/">Fresh Folk</a> lets you combine poses, outfits, and skin tones into different characters. The library also includes background elements (e.g., tables, seating, lamps, plants) to create different settings &mdash; from office spaces to nature scenes. Free for personal and commercial projects. </p>

### Real-Time Visualization Of Tokyo’s Public Transport

<p>A stunning 3D data visualization project comes from Akihiko Kusanagi: <a href="https://nagix.github.io/mini-tokyo-3d/#14/35.6814/139.767/0/60">Mini Tokyo 3D</a> displays Tokyo’s public transport system on a map in realtime.</p>

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://github.com/nagix/mini-tokyo-3d" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/bbcf41ec-e3ce-4c00-8fc1-a1481815b0c5/mini-tokyo-3d-large-preview.jpg" sizes="100vw" caption="<a href=''>Large preview</a>, a real-time 3D digital map of Tokyo's public transport system." alt="Tokyo’s public transportation system visualized on a map" >}}

<p>You can follow along Tokyo’s trains moving through the city, with information on the train line, train number, next and previous stops, and possible delays. The data for this mammoth project is sourced from Open Data Challenge for Public Transportation in Tokyo which promotes the openness of public transportation data. Their aim is to make public transportation (which is considered to be the world’s most complicated) easier to navigate. Inspiring! </p>

### Vintage Science And Tech Ads

<p>If you’ve got a sweet spot for vintage graphic design, here’s a very special goodie for you: a Flickr album with more than <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/bustbright/albums/72157612943324998">1,400 science and tech ads</a> from the 1950s and 60s.</p>

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/bustbright/albums/72157612943324998" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a9d292d8-ed5c-47c0-9f46-1212e7f67a9f/vintage-science-tech-ads-large-preview.png" sizes="100vw" caption="“<a href='https://www.flickr.com/photos/bustbright/albums/72157612943324998'>Science and Tech Ads</a>” (Flickr album), a random assortment of science ads collected from various science and tech magazines of the 50s and 60s." alt="Science and Tech Ads" >}}

<p>The ads come from various science and tech magazines and are great examples of the modernist mid-century aesthetic &mdash; and a fascinating journey back to the times when the foundations of the technologies we take for granted today were being laid. Eye candy! </p>

### JavaScript Frameworks Security Report 2019

<p>The folks at Snyk published their <a href="https://snyk.io/blog/javascript-frameworks-security-report-2019/">state of JavaScript frameworks security report for 2019</a>. It investigates the state of security for the Angular and React ecosystems as well as security practices for the popular JavaScript frameworks Vue.js, Bootstrap, and jQuery.</p>

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://snyk.io/blog/javascript-frameworks-security-report-2019/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7c33af87-e3e9-4f61-972b-4f914176207b/snyk-security-report-2019-large-preview.png" sizes="100vw" caption="<a href='https://snyk.io/blog/javascript-frameworks-security-report-2019/'>JavaScript Frameworks Security Report 2019</a>, a report that investigates the state of security for both the Angular and React ecosystems." alt="The opening slide from the security report" >}}

<p>Given the fact that Angular and React both have their proponents with ongoing discussions whether one or the other is a true framework, the report doesn’t intend to venture into rivalries but reviews each of them as viable front-end ecosystem alternatives, while focusing on security risks and best practices and the differences between them. A must-read. </p>

### Designing Accessible Color Systems

<p>Getting color contrast right is an essential part of making sure that not only people with visual impairments can easily use your product but also everyone else when they are in low-light environments or using older screens. However, if you’ve ever tried to create an accessible color system yourself, you probably know that this can be quite a challenge.</p>

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://stripe.com/en-de/blog/accessible-color-systems" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/3b0c7bbb-35ea-430e-8aa8-8853bb22c62c/accessible-color-systems-badges-preview.png" sizes="100vw" caption="“<a href='https://stripe.com/en-de/blog/accessible-color-systems'>Designing Accessible Color Systems</a>” written by Daryl Koopersmith and Wilson Miner." alt="A color system for icons consisting of nine colors" >}}

<p>The team at Stripe recently decided to tackle the challenge and redesign their existing color system. The benefits it should provide out of the box: pass accessibility guidelines, use clear and vibrant hues that users can easily distinguish from one another, and have a consistent visual weight without a color appearing to take priority over another. If you’re curious to find out more about their approach, their <a href="https://stripe.com/en-de/blog/accessible-color-systems">blog post</a> will give you valuable insights. </p>

### Digital Wellbeing Experiments

<p>Everyone has a different relationship with their phones, but we all have something in common: There are always those moments when it feels that phones distract from life rather than improve it &mdash; when having dinner with friends and everyone checks their incoming notifications, for example.</p>

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://experiments.withgoogle.com/collection/digitalwellbeing" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2ec0d4df-85c9-4b52-bc6f-68f91530cf54/digital-wellbeing-experiments-preview.png" sizes="100vw" caption="“<a href='https://experiments.withgoogle.com/collection/digitalwellbeing'>Digital Wellbeing Experiments</a>”, a showcase of ideas and tools that help people find a better balance with technology." alt="An illustration of a woman gone fishing on a deserted island. She’s surrounded by a camera and a video app icon" >}}

<p>With their <a href="https://experiments.withgoogle.com/collection/digitalwellbeing">Digital Wellbeing Experiments</a>, Google now showcases ideas and tools that help people find a better balance with technology and inspire designers and developers to consider digital wellbeing in everything they design and build. There are experiments that let you switch off from technology as a group, for example, stay focused by getting the right apps at the right times, or take the most important things with you on a printed “paper phone”. The code for the experiments is open-source, and if you have an idea for a digital wellbeing experiment, the Hack Pack will help you bring it to life. </p>

### Recursive: A Free Highly-Flexible Variable Font

<p>A font that gives you typographic control over five stylistic axes and can go from Sans to Mono? The variable font <a href="https://www.recursive.design/">Recursive</a> makes it possible, offering an entirely new level of flexibility.</p>

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://www.recursive.design/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7b13fc7a-0a92-465d-8aec-1c18081a4bfc/recursive-design-large-preview.png" sizes="100vw" caption="<a href='https://www.recursive.design/'>Recursive Font</a>, a typographic palette for vibrant code and UI." alt="A screenshot of the Recursive font" >}}

<p>Taking full advantage of variable font technology, Recursive enables you to choose from a wide range of predefined styles or dial in exactly what you want for each of its axes. Inspiration came from single-stroke casual signpainting to give the font a flexible and energetic look, making it a great fit for data-rich-apps, technical documentation, code editors, and much more. Please note that Recursive is still under active development and will soon be available through Google Fonts. A beta version is already available. </p>

### Open-Source Tutorials For Learning GraphQL

<p>GraphQL enables a client to specify exactly what data it needs from an API, so instead of multiple endpoints that return fixed data structures, a GraphQL server exposes a single endpoint and responds with precisely the data a client asked for. If you want to wrap your head around GraphQL, here are two great resources to get you started.</p>

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://github.com/hasura/learn-graphql" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/3b60675e-152e-4bd6-b15c-00836bbf39ff/hasura-dumbledore-preview.png" sizes="100vw" caption="There are a number of open-source community maintained <a href='https://github.com/hasura/learn-graphql'>tutorials</a> that will help you to move from the basics of GraphQL to building a real-time application in no time." alt="Illustration of a wizard and three little dragons who seem to be learning something from him" >}}

<p><a href="https://www.howtographql.com/"><em>How to GraphQL</em></a> is a free open-source tutorial to take your GraphQL skills from zero to production. Divided up into two parts, part one covers the core concepts of GraphQL while part two gives you a broader understanding of the GraphQL ecosystem. The other learning resource comes from the makers of the GraphQL engine Hasura: three <a href="https://learn.hasura.io/">open-source community-maintained tutorials</a> (front-end, mobile, and back-end tutorials) teach you GraphQL to get you ready to build a real-time application in two hours. </p>

### Fixing Image Orientation

<p>Image orientation on the web is, well, complicated. When Michael Scharnagl worked on a side project, he noticed that the images he uploaded to his server were shown in the wrong orientation. Now he wrote a <a href="https://justmarkup.com/articles/2019-10-21-image-orientation/">blog post</a> in which he dives deeper into the issue and how to fix it.</p>

{{< rimg href="https://justmarkup.com/articles/2019-10-21-image-orientation/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/75ba7989-8e9b-4496-90a8-dc5046aa9487/image-orientation-preview-example.jpg" sizes="100vw" caption="<a href='https://justmarkup.com/articles/2019-10-21-image-orientation/'>Image orientation on the web</a> explained by Michael Scharnagl." alt="Portrait image shown in landscape mode" >}}

<p>The reason for portrait images being displayed in landscape mode when they are embedded using <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> or <code>background-image</code> is the EXIF data for the image. How a browser deals with EXIF orientation depends on the browser, and there’s no cross-browser way to easily correct it either. Michael’s Node.js fix helps you correct the orientation. A handy little tip. </p>
