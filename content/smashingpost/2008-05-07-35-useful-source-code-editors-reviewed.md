To edit HTML- and CSS-code you only need a simple plaintext-editor — the rest depends on your skills and your creativity. However, to make your life a little bit easier, you can use some more <strong>comfortable source-code editors</strong> with advanced editing features. These features can effectively support you during coding, debugging and testing. Powerful modern editors provide developers with syntax highlighting, diff, macros, plugins, code-snippets, preview-option and an integrated <a title="10 Useful FTP Clients For Designers And Developers" href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/10-useful-ftp-clients-for-designers-and-developers/">FTP-management tool</a>. Some editors go even further and offer a complete integrated development environment with numerous features and functions. 

In the list below we present <strong>an overview of 35 established or rather unknown — but useful source code-editors</strong>; you'll probably find "usual suspects" — your favourite editor or the editor you've once been working with. But you'll also find some rather unknown alternatives which are definitely worth considering when choosing an optimal source code editor.

Some of the "ancient" text-editors such as EMacs or Vi are still alive and have achieved a remarkable level of quality over years. We've presented them below proving that sometimes it is really better to consider preferring a rather old editor to a "fresh" one. The position of the editors in the list is rather random and doesn't necessarily correspond to our personal evaluation of the editors. Please notice: even although this overview presents quite many editors, it doesn't mention all of them.

Yesterday we've published a <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/05/06/25-wysiwyg-editors-reviewed/">review of 20 WYSIWYG-editors</a>. Now, what about useful source code editors? What is your favourite?

## SubEthaEdit

<a href="https://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/">Subethaedit</a> (Mac)
SubEthaEdit is rather unknown, but a very powerful and lean text editor. What makes the editor different is its primary focus on <strong>collaborative web development</strong>. For instance, when using the editor you can see live what changes the other developers have introduced — in their or in your documents. When a source code file in your project has been changed, the tool notifies you immediately in the main window.

The editor includes advanced editing features such as a UNIX command line utility to enable complex and interactive pipe workflows with your terminal, completely user customizable syntax highlighting through styles, support for editing files as administrator. Improved AppleScript support to allow control of sharing features is also available. A definitive choice for collaborative coding process. Price: $29. A 30-days trial version is available.

Coda also boasts a new Find/Replace mechanism, which allows users to do complex replaces using a method similar to regular expressions.

## Emacs

<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> (22 operating systems, among them Linux, Mac OS X and Windows)
Emacs (<em>Editor MACroS</em>) is the classic and <strong>legacy editing application</strong> among Linux-editors. It is the oldest (1976) and the most authoritative editor presented in this overview. There is a large number of extensions that add further functionalities, including a project planner, mail and news reader, debugger interface, calendar, and more.

The editor is popular for its built-in <strong>macros and powerful keyboard shortcuts</strong> that make editing text documents very efficient. However, you need to climb the learning curve which is quite time-consuming and isn't easy to achieve for beginners. You can also consider GNU Emacs and XEmacs which are both advanced, open source and cross plattform versions of EMacs. Emacs is freeware and is released under GNU-License. An advanced option for hardcore-programmers.

## Vim

<a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> (all)
Vim (<em>Vi IMproved</em>), first released by Bram Moolenaar in 1991 for the Amiga computer, is a legend. It is a highly configurable <strong>console text editor</strong> built to enable efficient text editing. It is an improved version of the vi editor distributed with most UNIX systems. The editor is often called a "programmer's editor" for keyboard macros and powerful set of programmer's tools and it is so useful for programming that many consider it an entire IDE. Like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi">vi</a>, Vim's interface is based not on menus or icons but on commands given in a text user interface.

<a href="https://www.vim.org/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async"  src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f9290c63-6888-4473-9d54-3dcb6e2864a8/vim.gif" alt="Screenshot" width="450" height="370" /></a>

Vim has derived from Vi which looks pretty nasty although is pretty powerful. You may want to check out <a href="https://www.vim.org/download.php#pc">gVim</a> or <a href="https://portablegvim.sourceforge.net/">gVim Portable</a> for Windows (with graphical user interface) and <a href="https://code.google.com/p/macvim/">MacVim</a> for the Mac.

Vim is extremely powerful. With this editor you can do everything you might ever think of. Vim isn't simple, it isn't intuitive and it isn't user-friendly: it is a tool, the use of which must be learned. A <strong>nice application to start becoming a coding ninja with</strong>.

*   syntax highlighting for over 200 languages (you can define your own syntax)
*   Edit-Compile-Fix: You edit a program, type ":make" and Vim shows the error messages in a window.
*   highlighting matches: when you search for a pattern, all matches found can be highlighted.
*   you can map keys, change the colors, add new commands, use scripts
*   completion, comparison and merging of files (vimdiff)
*   extended regular expressions
*   scripting languages (both native and through alternative scripting interpreters such as Perl, Python, Ruby, Tcl, etc.)
*   folding: a range of lines can be hidden, and one line displayed instead. This gives a quick overview of what a file contains.
*   editing of compressed or archived files in gzip, bzip2, zip, and tar format and files over network protocols such as SSH, FTP, and HTTP
*   session state preservation
*   unicode and other multi-language support
*   trans-session command
*   cursor position histories
