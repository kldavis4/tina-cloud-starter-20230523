{{% feature-panel %}}

1.  After you try these tutorials, try experimenting with them. If it involves a filter, mess around with the different settings so you can **see if you can come up with something different.** You can also play around with the colors, fonts, textures, and other elements of the design.
2.  Try combining the different tutorials into one design.
3.  Don't overdo it. If you took a look at the examples that I showed you on the first part of the series, you will see that the designs aren't overdone and the elements and the effects are just right.
4.  Submit your work to the [Design Informer Flickr group](https://www.flickr.com/groups/designinformer/). After we get enough submissions, we will try to showcase the best designs every month. This is a great way for you and your designs to **get some exposure.**
