  Your workplace and the atmosphere surrounding you determine the way you work
  and explore your imagination. The more inspirational your workplace is, the
  easier it is to break the creativity block and discover new ideas. And
  apparently there is a number of things you can do to improve your personal
  workflow.

  As a part of our Monday Inspiration series we present **a dozen of creative
  and unusual workplaces**; in the end of the post you'll also find references
  to related resources, among them office design galleries and Flickr pools.
  They can serve as an inspiration once you've decided to spice up your work
  environment.

  You can also click on the images — they lead to the sites from which the
  screenshots have been taken.
