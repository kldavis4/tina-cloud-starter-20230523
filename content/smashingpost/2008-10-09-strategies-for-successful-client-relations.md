  Let’s face it. Some days, you want to just fire your **clients**. You go

  happened to everyone at least once and I’d be lying if I said it won’t happen
  again; you get to the end of a project and realize that you would have made

Let’s face it. Some days, you want to just fire your <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/12/designing-with-your-clients/">clients</a>. You go through one too many comps, iterations or edits and you’ve had enough. It has happened to everyone at least once and I’d be lying if I said it won’t happen again; you get to the end of a project and realize that you would have made more per hour flipping burgers at McDonald’s. Thankfully, as with most common problems, there are a few simple <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/workflow-tips-guidelines-web-designers/">guidelines</a> that you can follow to help make sure that you’re never working for below minimum wage. 

## Due Diligence

<em>“Experts often possess <strong>more data than judgment</strong>.” -Colin Powell</em>

### Know your role

Remember that the client will always know more about their product or service than you do. They are the expert at what they do; their problem is usually that they don’t know how to explain it well. That is where you, as the designer, step in to help. You are a <strong>graphical communications ninja</strong>, but to effectively make your, and ultimately your client’s, point you must fully understand what needs to be said.

From the outset, make it a priority to get as much information as possible about the company, their product or service, the intended audience of your work and the reason that your work needs to exist. The better prepared you are and the more information you get out of the client before you start working, the quicker your design will be accepted, and the quicker you will get paid. Use that overflow of data from the client to form a coherent picture of what you’re trying to accomplish and then use your good judgment to make something beautiful from the madness. By spending ample time collecting information, you have allowed the client to share their knowledge and participate in the project. This is a good thing. When clients feel they are part of the process they are less likely to question the design decisions you make.

### Hire the right customers

<em>“If you try and please everyone, <strong>you won’t please anyone.</strong>” -<a title="hire the right customers" href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch04_Hire_the_Right_Customers.php">37signals</a></em>

Remember that part of your due diligence is making sure that the project is a good fit for you as a designer. You cannot be everything to everyone, and if you try to be, you will not only look bad, you’ll lose money.

Remember the principle that carries the <a title="pareto principle" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Vilfredo Pareto</a> name: 80% of the output will come from 20% of the input. In other words, you will make 80% of your income from 20% of your clients, so <strong>focus on the good ones and fire the bad ones</strong>. Stay true to your strengths and don’t be afraid to pass on a project. In the end, everyone, including your client, will be better off.</p>

### I repeat…

Don’t try to take on every project that comes across your desk, even when you’re starting out. This will preclude a large percentage of your client problems. By picking your two or three biggest strengths and building a solid reputation, you will attract clients who are looking for a genius in your fields of choice and who, consequently, will be willing to pay well for the service.

The Harvard Business professor <a title="Michael Porter" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Porter">Michael Porter</a> states you can hold a competitive advantage in one, and only one, of two areas: <strong>price or quality</strong>. Focus your efforts on your strengths, build a solid reputation and you’ll never be forced to compete on price again.</p>

## Communication

<em>“The most important thing in communication is to <strong>hear what isn’t being said</strong>.” -<a title="Peter F. Drucker" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker">Peter F. Drucker</a></em>

### Approach all communication with a Zen mind

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/38702da1-fafe-449a-9776-89d7fecf55bd/zen.jpg" alt="zen" width="450" height="221" /><br>
<em>original image by <a title="Zen" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/whoisthatfreakwiththecamera/2562204088/">isa_adsr</a></em>

Zen philosophy teaches you to approach every task with a <a title="beginner’s mind" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin">beginner’s mind</a>. This is simple when you’re trying to teach yourself hyper-astro-meta-particle physics, but not as easy as you think when it comes to something you do all day, every day. Try hard to put yourself in the shoes of a beginner; you will be more apt to understand and sympathize with your client's point of view. You will also find that by <strong>using less jargon</strong> (by assuming the language of a beginner) your client will understand and internalize your point much more quickly, which in turn helps to create an evangelist for your work in your client’s organization, which always makes your life easier.

But adopting a beginner’s mind isn’t as simple as dropping your haughty design-speak in favor of a fifth grade vocabulary. You need to approach each conversation or communication as a beginner does, with no expectations and no preconceived notions. Without the benefit of assumptions or preconceived notions, you will be forced to ask more questions and in turn draw more information out of the client; and just like that, your job will have gotten easier. Disclaimer: If all this Zen stuff is too new age for you, just remember the old adage: When you assume, you make an ass out of u and me.</p>

### Listen for what isn’t there

<em><strong>What the client says:</strong> Can you make that text just a little bigger?
<strong>What the client means:</strong> This font might be a little hard to read. What do you think?</em>

Everyone fears the dreaded “Make this text bigger” line, and everyone (well, almost everyone) has probably cringed and then painfully capitulated. When faced with clients asking for design changes, especially from those clients who don’t have any design training (let alone a good eye for design), it’s important to <strong>check your design ego at the door</strong> and ask a few pointed questions. What you really need to find out is what the client actually means. Before doing anything to the design, pause for a moment and ask the client to explain what it is about the design that doesn’t accomplish the specific goals you outlined in the pre-work discovery meetings. (You did set specific goals, didn’t you!?)

#### _Here are a few tips to help you get to the point:_

*   Ask blunt questions (but tactfully). Don't start or get hauled into arguments.
*   Use feature/benefit terminology and plain language, not design-speak.
*   Use yes/no questions that push the client to reveal what they really think (e.g. "Do you think this font is hard to read?").
*   Take criticism well. (No one likes an overly sensitive artist.)

By your focusing on the goals rather than the implementation, clients will understand that you are trying to use your craft for their benefit, not just to take their money. Oh, and a note about that ego you left at the door: now is not the time to go into a diatribe about your profession or your skill as a designer. No one cares; your client just wants a functional design that they can be proud of when they show it to their boss.</p>

### Do what you said you were going to do

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/06232c94-463e-4b9b-a7ad-5b590ccf4aee/contract.jpg" alt="contract" width="450" height="221" />

<strong>But don’t die by the contract</strong>. I’ve heard of many situations where clients and designers get into arguments about what was and wasn't in the original contract. If the client comes to you with something that is obviously beyond the scope of the contract, you have a few choices:

1.  You can **do** what the client wants and ask **for nothing more** in return.
2.  You can **refuse to do** it and stick to what the original contract said.
3.  You can try to **renegotiate** the contract to a new middle ground before continuing work on the project.

There isn’t any one right answer here; different situations call for different actions. If you’re not going to get badly burned by going the extra mile, it will probably be worth it (so long as the client knows you’re hooking them up). That said, sometimes the new request is outrageous and would take many, many hours to implement. In those situations, it is a good idea to be open, talk it through with the client, make it known that you’d love to help but it would be too much of a time commitment (you do have other clients, after all) for the current numbers to work out.

If you approach things with an open mind, with a positive attitude (instead of a demanding one) and on an even playing field, the client will generally help you out with a bit more cash. And if they are livid at the thought of paying you more money for more work, well, they may have just singled themselves out as a client who needs to be fired.</p>

### Admit it when you screw up

<strong>Then do everything possible to make it right</strong>. Mistakes are okay; everyone makes them from time to time. Hopefully you’re not a habitual offender. But the general rule is: the sooner you recognize the mistake and take the heat for it, the better off you’ll be in the long run.

By letting more time pass, the mistake only grows and becomes more difficult to cover up, and the heat that was originally a small and controlled campfire is now the roaring flames of hell licking at the bottoms of your feet. Get it out of the way, clear the air and get on with it. Your client will appreciate your candor and honesty, even if he or she isn’t that happy about the problem itself.</p>

Hopefully you’ve started to catch on here. Most of the things that can be counted as “common problems” are fairly easy to circumvent, especially if you put in your time doing your due diligence on the front end and adopt a firm but cooperative attitude in your client communications.

Remember, clients aren’t supposed to be a burden. They are a blessing (they are buying the bread on your table after all). But the relationship should always be mutually beneficial. You are getting paid to do what you, presumably, love to do, and the client is getting something beautiful and functional. Hopefully, you’re both learning a little something along the way.
