## Insights From The Designer:

<blockquote>"I've always worked with 'quality, not quantity' approach to design. Ever since I created my first icon set back in 2007, the detail and the balance of an icon have been the two 'ingredients' I've always paid close attention to. It took me almost 2 years to finally bring to life the concept of the Vintage Flat Icons bundle that I'd come up with, but I feel like it was worth every second.

When creating icons, the biggest challenge, I find, is not only to come up with accessible metaphors, but also to create a color scheme that will emphasize and unravel the idea behind the set. The Vintage Flat Icons, as suggested by the name, were created with two of the most popular design trends of today - 'flat' and 'vintage' - which are reflected in the shapes, as well as the colors of this set. And, by the way, these icons are designed to look good on both light and dark backgrounds, to add diversity to your work and the icons themselves."
