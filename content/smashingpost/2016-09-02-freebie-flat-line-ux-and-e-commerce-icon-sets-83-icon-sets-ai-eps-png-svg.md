### Insights From The Designer

<blockquote>"The 45 Flat Line User Experience Icon Set came from a need for UX (User Experience) icons as opposed to the abundance of User Interface icon sets. The retro color scheme and shapes are an escape from the standard ones. The icons are created in 2px line/stroke design filled with colors and details in line style as shapes. The stroke/line are fully editable in the .eps and .ai file.

With online shopping galloping in retail stats like a purebred stallion towards the finish line at the Royal Ascot, no wonder that e-commerce is in high demand. Together with SEO and social media icons, e-commerce icons are some of the most requested sets. As they always come in handy, these 38 E-Commerce Linear Icons are ready to take their job seriously and show up in all the right places. The designer of the collection literally keeps all her ideas and inspiration for colors, designs, shapes, in a special folder. This system helps her quickly answer to the customer’s preferences. Although there are many free e-commerce icons out there, design-wise they aren’t too adventurous. It was the regular RGB colors that inspired the designer to create the color scheme. These are clean, elegant linear e-comm icons with a retro touch - in 2px stroke design on fresh color backgrounds. The stroke/line are fully editable in the .eps and .ai file."</blockquote>
