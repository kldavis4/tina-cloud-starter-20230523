In this article, I‚Äôll be explaining how I‚Äôve used [Gatsby Functions](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/functions/) and the [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) API to enable secure ‚ÄúPay what you want‚Äù contributions that help fund my open-source project [MDX Embed](https://www.mdx-embed.com/).

**Note**: *MDX Embed allows you to easily embed popular third-party media content such as YouTube videos, Tweets, Instagram posts, Egghead lessons, Spotify, TikTok and many more straight into your `.mdx` &mdash; no import required.*

## Gatsby Serverless Functions

[Gatsby Functions](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/functions/) open up a whole new world for front-end developers as they provide a way to write and use server-side code without the hassle of maintaining a server. Uses for Serverless Functions range from Newsletter signups with [ConvertKit](https://convertkit.com/), sending an email using [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/), saving data in a database like [Fauna](https://fauna.com/), or in this case, accepting secure payments using [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) &mdash; the list is quite frankly endless!

Third-party services like the ones mentioned above will only accept requests that are sent server-side. There‚Äôs a number of reasons for this but using secure or private keys is typically one. Using these keys server-side means they‚Äôre not exposed to the client (browser) and can‚Äôt be abused, and it‚Äôs here where Gatsby‚Äôs Serverless Functions can help.

[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) provides the same logical approach to Serverless Functions as they do with pages. For example, website pages are located in `src/pages` and Serverless Functions are located in `src/api`.

Naturally, there‚Äôs slightly more to it than that but Gatsby‚Äôs developer experience is both logical and consistent, and I for one absolutely love that!

## Same Origin Functions

Nine times out of ten when working with Serverless Functions you‚Äôll be using them the way they were supposed to be used, E.g, your website uses its own functions. I call this usage **Same Origin Functions** or SOF‚Äôs for short. In this scenario both the Front-end and the API are deployed to the same origin, E.g [www.my-website.com](www.my-website.com), and [www.my-website.com/api](www.my-website.com/api), and communication between the two is both seamless and, of course, blazing fast!

Here‚Äôs a diagram to help illustrate what that looks like:

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e1ba8f0a-7d06-4fb0-8664-08d51b8a9f25/1-monetize-open-source-software-gatsby-functions-stripe.jpg" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e1ba8f0a-7d06-4fb0-8664-08d51b8a9f25/1-monetize-open-source-software-gatsby-functions-stripe.jpg" width="800" height="450" sizes="100vw" caption="A Gatsby website using its own Serverless Functions.

## Cross-Origin Functions

There are, however, at least two scenarios I‚Äôve encountered where I‚Äôve needed what I‚Äôve been calling ‚ÄúCross-Origin Functions‚Äù (or COF‚Äôs for short). The two scenarios where I‚Äôve needed COF‚Äôs are as follows:

1. I need server-side capabilities but the origin website can‚Äôt run Serverless Functions.
2. The Serverless Function is used by more than one origin.

**Note**: *Using Gatsby isn‚Äôt the only way to write Serverless Functions but more on that in a moment.*

I first experimented with this approach in November 2020 before the release of Gatsby Functions and used Netlify Functions to provide server-to-server communications with the Twitter API and my Gatsby blog and commercial portfolio. You can read about this approach here: [Use Netlify Functions and the Twitter API v2 as a CMS for your Gatsby blog](https://paulie.dev/posts/2020/11/gatsby-netlify-twitter/).

After the release of Gatsby Functions in June 2021 I refactored the above to work with Gatsby Functions and here‚Äôs a little more information about how I went about it and why: [Using Gatsby Functions as an abstracted API](https://paulie.dev/posts/2021/06/gatsby-abstracted-functions/).

Here‚Äôs a diagram to better illustrate the general approach.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/52d07d29-6fe4-4b5e-9040-0e1fea0fd493/2-monetize-open-source-software-gatsby-functions-stripe.jpg" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/52d07d29-6fe4-4b5e-9040-0e1fea0fd493/2-monetize-open-source-software-gatsby-functions-stripe.jpg" width="800" height="450" sizes="100vw" caption="Two websites using a Gatsby API‚Äôs Serverless Functions. (<a href='https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/52d07d29-6fe4-4b5e-9040-0e1fea0fd493/2-monetize-open-source-software-gatsby-functions-stripe.jpg'>Large preview</a>)" alt="Diagram of cross origin function" >}}

In the above diagram `website-1.com` is built with Gatsby and *could* have used Serverless Functions (but doesn‚Äôt) and `website-2.com` is built using something that has no Serverless Function capabilities.

**Note**: *In both cases, they both need to use the same third-party service so it makes sense to abstract this functionality into a standalone API.*

The example standalone API (`my-api.com`) is also a Gatsby site and has Serverless Function capabilities, but more importantly, it allows websites from other origins to use its Serverless Functions.

I know what you‚Äôre thinking: CORS! Well, sit tight. I‚Äôll cover this shortly.

## üí∞ Monetizing MDX Embed

This was the situation I found myself in with MDX Embed. The documentation website for this project is built using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). Storybook has no serverless capabilities but I really needed server-to-server communication. My solution? I created a standalone API called [Paulie API](https://paulieapi.gatsbyjs.io/).

### Paulie API

Paulie API (like the example standalone API mentioned above) can accept requests from websites of different origins and can connect to a number of different third-party services, one of which is Stripe.

To enable Stripe payments from MDX Embed, I created an `api/make-stripe-payment` endpoint on Paulie API which can pass the relevant information from MDX Embed through its own Serverless Function and on to the Stripe API to create a ‚Äúcheckout‚Äù. You can [see the src code here](https://github.com/PaulieScanlon/paulie-api/blob/main/src/api/make-stripe-payment.js).

Once a checkout has been successfully created, the Stripe API returns a URL. This URL is passed back to MDX Embed which opens a new window in the browser where ‚Äúcustomers‚Äù can securely enter their payment details on a Stripe webpage... and boom! You get paid!

Here‚Äôs a diagram that better illustrates how this works:

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/76efecc6-ff6b-49d0-b522-b71da1b92f2d/3-monetize-open-source-software-gatsby-functions-stripe.jpg" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/76efecc6-ff6b-49d0-b522-b71da1b92f2d/3-monetize-open-source-software-gatsby-functions-stripe.jpg" width="800" height="450" sizes="100vw" caption="MDX Embed connecting to the Stripe API via Paulie API‚Äôs Serverless Functions. (<a href='https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/76efecc6-ff6b-49d0-b522-b71da1b92f2d/3-monetize-open-source-software-gatsby-functions-stripe.jpg'>Large preview</a>)" alt="Diagram of MDX Embed using Paulie API" >}}

This approach is the same as mentioned above where [https://mdx-embed.com](https://mdx-embed.com) sends requests to [https://paulieapi.gatsbyjs.io](https://paulieapi.gatsbyjs.io) which in turn connects to the Stripe API using server-to-server communication. But before we go too much further, it‚Äôs worth explaining why I didn‚Äôt use [`react-stripe-js`](https://github.com/stripe/react-stripe-js).

### `react-stripe-js`

[`react-stripe-js`](https://github.com/stripe/react-stripe-js) is a client-side (browser) toolkit that allows you to create Stripe checkouts and elements in your React project. With react-stripe-js you can set up a method for accepting payments securely without the need for server-side communication, but‚Ä¶ and there is a but. I wanted to implement ‚ÄúPay what you want‚Äù contributions. Allow me to explain.

Here‚Äôs a screenshot of the MDX Embed ‚Äúproduct‚Äù that I‚Äôve set up in my Stripe dashboard. Notice the price is $1.00.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4e4c8934-ae67-4127-b616-c6a941eb6829/4-monetize-open-source-software-gatsby-functions-stripe.jpg" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4e4c8934-ae67-4127-b616-c6a941eb6829/4-monetize-open-source-software-gatsby-functions-stripe.jpg" width="800" height="450" sizes="100vw" caption="Stripe dashboard product section. (<a href='https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4e4c8934-ae67-4127-b616-c6a941eb6829/4-monetize-open-source-software-gatsby-functions-stripe.jpg'>Large preview</a>)" alt="Screenshot of Stripe dashboard with a price of $1.00 for the MDX Embed Product" >}}

If I‚Äôd used react-stripe-js to enable payments all ‚Äúcustomers‚Äù would be asked to pay the same amount. In this case, it‚Äôs only $1.00 and that‚Äôs not gonna pay the bills is it!

To enable ‚ÄúPay what you want‚Äù (e.g. a nominal amount chosen by a ‚Äúcustomer‚Äù), you have to dive a little deeper and use server-to-server communication and send this amount to the Stripe API using a custom HTTP request. This is where I'm using a Gatsby Function and I pass in a dynamic value which will then be used to create the ‚Äúcheckout‚Äù experience and overwrite the price defined in my Stripe dashboard.

On MDX Embed, I‚Äôve added an HTML `<input type="number" />` which allows ‚Äúcustomers‚Äù to set an amount rather than paying a predefined amount &mdash; if only all e-commerce were like this!

Here‚Äôs a little video I made that shows how MDX Embed, Paulie API and the Stripe API all work together:

{{< vimeo id="605497778" caption="How MDX Embed, Paulie API and the Stripe API work together to enable ‚ÄúPay what you want‚Äù." breakout="true" >}}

By passing the input value from MDX Embed to Paulie API which in turn connects to the Stripe API I'm able to create a ‚Äúdynamic‚Äù checkout.

**Note**: *This now means that ‚Äúcustomers‚Äù can decide what the project is worth to them and set an appropriate amount to contribute.*

I‚Äôd like to mention [Benedicte Raae](https://twitter.com/raae) at this point who first showed me this approach during her fabulous *Summer Functions* course. You can find out more by visiting [Queen Raae Codes](https://queen.raae.codes/). (*Thanks Benedicte, you‚Äôre the best!*)

## Let‚Äôs Talk About CORS

By default, Gatsby Serverless Functions won‚Äôt be blocked by CORS since the Front-end and the API are deployed to the same origin. When developing Cross-Origin Functions, however, you‚Äôll need to configure your API so it accepts requests from origins different to that of its own.

Here‚Äôs a code snippet to show how I handle CORS in the `api/make-stripe-payment` endpoint:

<pre><code class="language-javascript">// src/api/make-stripe-payment

const stripe = require('stripe')(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY)
import Cors from 'cors'

const allowedOrigins = [
  'https://www.mdx-embed.com',
  'https://paulie.dev',
]


const cors = Cors({
  origin: (origin, callback) =&gt; {
    if (allowedOrigins.includes(origin)) {
      callback(null, true)
    } else {
      callback(new Error())
    }
  },
})

const runCorsMiddleware = (req, res) =&gt; {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {
    cors(req, res, (result) =&gt; {
      if (result instanceof Error) {
        return reject(result)
      }
      return resolve(result)
    })
  })
}

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const { success_url, cancel_url, amount, product } = req.body

  try {
    await runCorsMiddleware(req, res)

    try {
      const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
        success_url: success_url,
        cancel_url: cancel_url,
        payment_method_types: ['card'],
        line_items: [
          {
            quantity: 1,
            price_data: {
              unit_amount: amount * 100,
              currency: 'usd',
              product: product,
            },
          },
        ],
        mode: 'payment',
      })

      res.status(200).json({ message: 'üï∫ Stripe checkout created ok', url: session.url })
    } catch (error) {
      res.status(500).json({ message: 'üö´ Stripe checkout error' })
    }
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(403).json({ message: 'üö´ Request blocked by CORS' })
  }
}</code></pre>

In the above code snippet you should be able to see I‚Äôve defined an array of `allowedOrigins`, these are the only origins allowed to use this endpoint. Requests from any other origin will receive a status code `403` and a message of `üö´ Request blocked by CORS`.

This function also accepts a number of body parameters, one of which is the `amount` the ‚Äúcustomer‚Äù has decided to pay, this is the value from the HTML input on the MDX Embed site. You‚Äôll also notice the `product` parameter, this is the product id defined in my Stripe dashboard and how the Stripe API creates the correct ‚Äúcheckout‚Äù URL. Passing this value as a body parameter rather than hardcoding it in the function allows me to re-use this endpoint for other Stripe products.

## üçã Is The Juice Worth The Squeeze?

I‚Äôve mentioned a few things along the way for why I decided to go this route. After all, it may well seem like a more complicated way to use Serverless Functions but I have my reasons, and I think it is worth it. Here‚Äôs why. üëá

Paulie API is both a Cross-Origin API and a documentation site. Naturally, if you‚Äôre going to write an API it has to be documented right?

This is where it works in my favor to use Gatsby to power my API because along with Serverless capabilities Paulie API is also a Gatsby website, and because it‚Äôs actually a website I can fill it with content and make it look pretty, but wait there‚Äôs more‚Ä¶

**Note:** *Paulie API is also an interactive API playground!* üòµ

Each function has a `‚ñ∂ Run in browser` link. This takes you to a page on the site where you can interact with the function. It serves as both a useful testing ground while I'm developing the function and an easy way to demonstrate how the function works, docs are good, interactive docs are better!

I also use this API to provide similar server-side functionality for my other websites. Take a look at the [About page](https://paulieapi.gatsbyjs.io/about) where I‚Äôve documented which of my sites use which functions, and here‚Äôs a diagram to illustrate how it all currently comes together.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2f8b3462-e9b3-447d-a9da-aa0e3aa7af78/5-monetize-open-source-software-gatsby-functions-stripe.jpg" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2f8b3462-e9b3-447d-a9da-aa0e3aa7af78/5-monetize-open-source-software-gatsby-functions-stripe.jpg" width="800" height="450" sizes="100vw" caption="Paulie API cross origin function capabilities. (<a href='https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2f8b3462-e9b3-447d-a9da-aa0e3aa7af78/5-monetize-open-source-software-gatsby-functions-stripe.jpg'>Large preview</a>)" alt="Diagram of Paulie API‚Äôs cross origin functions" >}}

You should see from the above diagram that [https://paulie.dev](https://paulie.dev) also uses the Stripe endpoint. I‚Äôve used the same approach as with MDX Embed to enable the ‚ÄúPay what you want‚Äù functionality. It‚Äôs a small thing, but since the `make-stripe-payment` endpoint is already written and working, I can re-use it and avoid duplicating this functionality.

The [https://paulie.dev](https://paulie.dev) website also has its own Gatsby Serverless Functions which I use to post user reactions to Fauna and capture Newsletter signups. This functionality is unique to this site so I haven‚Äôt abstracted this yet. However, if I wanted newsletter sign-ups on [https://www.pauliescanlon.io](https://www.pauliescanlon.io), this would be the point where I migrate the function over to Paulie API.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/235c79d0-b1a4-45a3-9325-6158e479cee1/6-monetize-open-source-software-gatsby-functions-stripe.jpg" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/235c79d0-b1a4-45a3-9325-6158e479cee1/6-monetize-open-source-software-gatsby-functions-stripe.jpg" width="800" height="450" sizes="100vw" caption="paulie.dev‚Äôs ‚ÄúPay what you want‚Äù section.

## Abstraction

This might seem like a step backwards to abstract your Serverless Functions. After all, one of the coolest things about going serverless is that both your front and back-end code are live in the same place. As I‚Äôve shown, there are times where abstracting makes sense &mdash; to me anyway.

I‚Äôm certainly benefitting from using this approach and plan to further develop my API to provide more functionality to a number of my own websites, but if making money from open-source is of interest to you and your site isn‚Äôt built using Gatsby, this approach may well be the answer you were looking for.
