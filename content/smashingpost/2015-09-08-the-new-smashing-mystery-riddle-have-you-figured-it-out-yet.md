Ah, these <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-smashing-book-mystery-is-resolved-gifs-crazy-people-all-that-malarkey/">mystery</a> <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-mystery-resolved-the-rain-that-never-stops-frightened-cats-cake-is-a-lie/">riddles</a> <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/03/31/the-mystery-is-resolved-a-story-of-invisible-letters-and-shady-characters/">never stop</a>, do they? To celebrate our ninth birthday, weâ€™ve prepared yet another riddle, and this time it will require a bit more teamwork. <strong>We've hidden secret keys in different (physical) locations across the world.</strong> To move from one level to another, you'll have to find a hidden print-out in all (four) locations. Watch out for GIF file names.

To find the key password, you have to follow the clues and hints in a series of animated GIFs. Once put together, the keys will add up to a secret Twitter hashtag. Below you'll find the <strong>first animated GIF that contains a location clue</strong>. Identify the location, go there (yourself, or ask a friend, colleague or a total stranger) and find a hidden print-out.

Once you've reached the last level (you'll know when), just tweet out all the keys in one single hashtag to <a href="https://twitter.com/smashingmag">@smashingmag</a> on Twitter! Not <em>that</em> difficult, right?

Alright, let's get down to business. Are you ready? Action! (And good luck!)
