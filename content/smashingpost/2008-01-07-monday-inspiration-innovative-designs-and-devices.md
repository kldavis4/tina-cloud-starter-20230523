  Steve Jobs stated once that the “design is not just what it looks like and
  feels like. **Design is how it works.**” While this statement has proven to be
  crucial over thousands of years, one shouldn't misinterpret it by emphasizing
  the functionality _despite_ the design. When it comes to product design, the
  significance of aesthetics of a given device, the way its design _looks and
  feels_, determines the choice of the customer once the functionalities of
  multiple devices are more or less similar. If supported by sound user
  interface and a well-tested, clean implementation, innovative design solutions
  can drastically enhance the user experience.

Steve Jobs stated once that the “design is not just what it looks like and feels like. <strong>Design is how it works.</strong>” While this statement has proven to be crucial over thousands of years, one shouldn't misinterpret it by emphasizing the functionality <em>despite</em> the design. When it comes to product design, the significance of aesthetics of a given device, the way its design <em>looks and feels</em>, determines the choice of the customer once the functionalities of multiple devices are more or less similar. If supported by sound user interface and a well-tested, clean implementation, innovative design solutions can drastically enhance the user experience. 

This article presents <strong>innovative, futuristic gadgets, devices, designs and concepts</strong>. Unless explicitly specified, none of these cut-edge concepts is currently being manufactured. None of them is available for end-users which is why neither the price nor links to the stores are mentioned.

Please <strong>keep in mind</strong> that the main idea of this article is not to do the sell-talk for trendy products, but to showcase innovative design solutions and futuristic devices which can become reality in 2008 or over the next few years.

## Sony's Apple Remote Control

<a href="https://www.techeblog.com/index.php/tech-gadget/pictures-sony-s-apple-remote-is-motion-sensitive">Sony's Apple Remote Control</a>
Is there any place for innovation when it comes to the design of remote controls? Apparently, there is. This Sony's"apple" allows users to perform basic functions like <strong>changing channels</strong>, volume etc. with simple motion gestures (see image below). Once "apples" are placed on the bowl, the remote control is being recharged. Neither price nor production dates are known.

## Optimus Tactus & Optimus Maximus

Artemy Lebedev's Optimus keyboards offer an unusual approach for a traditional input device. A small OLED-display (Organic Display) is placed beneath every key to enable users to define displayed characters and the keys' functionality manually. In other words, with Optimus the placement of labels on the keyboard can be varied at any time.

<a href="https://www.artlebedev.com/everything/optimus-tactus/">Optimus Tactus</a> does not have physical keys, which means there are no restrictions on their shape and size. Any part of the keyboard surface <strong>can be programmed to perform any function or to display any images</strong>. Production date and price: unknown.

<a href="https://www.artlebedev.com/everything/optimus/">Optimus Maximus</a>. Each of the 113 keys is a stand-alone display that shows the function currently assigned to it. Optimus’s customizable layout allows convenient use of any language — Cyrillic, Ancient Greek, Georgian, Arabic, Quenya, hiragana, etc. — as well as of any other character sets: notes, numerals, special symbols, HTML codes, math functions and so on to infinity. Production date: the end of January 2008, price: 460$.

## Duofone

The main idea behind <a href="https://www.yankodesign.com/index.php/2007/07/09/it-takes-two-me-and-you/">Duofone</a> is the possibility to <strong>put multiple devices together to combine their screen real estate</strong>. The battery power can be shared, and a movie can be watched on a larger screen.

## Dual Music Player

Compared to traditional music players, this <a href="https://www.yankodesign.com/index.php/2007/08/09/dual-music-player-that-plays-your-mp3-collection-your-cds/">Dual Music Player</a> is different. It is a portable solution that <strong>supports both CDs and Flash-memory</strong>.

## Vaio Zoom

The <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gadgets/slick/vaio-zoom-concept-is-exactly-how-we-want-laptops-to-look-in-the-future-301098.php">Vaio Zoom notebook</a> takes everything we know about holographic technology and squeezes it inside a thin glass form factor. When off, the screen is completely transparent and the keyboard goes opaque. Turn it on and the <strong>touchscreen holographic</strong> festivities begin. Even the mouse buttons are holographic!

## Visual Desktop Charger

Quite often the details are not the details. They make the design. Saying that, Charles Eames was right: the beauty of <a href="https://www.yankodesign.com/index.php/2007/11/14/visual-desktop-charger/">Visual Desktop Charger</a> lies in its close attention to small details. The device is a <strong>visual indicator of the charge status of a mobile phone</strong>. It is supposed to like like a "bird bath-like charger, complete with radiating rings of light to indicate charge status and to top it all off, thirsty birds that glow once the rings of light hit ‘em."

## Omaura HTPC

Omaura Home Theater Personal PC is a new face in HTPCs. "When we first opened the PDF containing the concept images of Omaura's concept TT chassis, we thought for a second it was a large, TV-stand-ready all-in-one PC whose display had a seriously distorted aspect ratio. We'll confess to a little disappointment once we realized it was simply an upright case, but that shot of its interior got us excited again. Imagine sticking the TT on a low-profile table under your wall-mounted LCD or plasma screen."
