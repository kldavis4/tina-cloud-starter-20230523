You didn't really think we'd wrap up our <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-smashing-book-mystery-is-resolved-gifs-crazy-people-all-that-malarkey/">endless</a>, <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-mystery-resolved-the-rain-that-never-stops-frightened-cats-cake-is-a-lie/">mischievous</a> <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/03/31/the-mystery-is-resolved-a-story-of-invisible-letters-and-shady-characters/">mystery</a> <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/07/21/mystery-resolved-lost-numbers/">riddles</a> just like that, did you? Well, the Mystery continues! To celebrate the launch of the <a href="https://www.smashingconf.com/ny-2015/">SmashingConf NYC 2015</a>, we’ve prepared a new mystery riddle, and this one will be an <strong>exercise in patience and stubborness</strong>. No, it's not going to be an easy one this time either, but the reward is definitely worth the effort.

How does it work? Well, you know how it works. Below you’ll find the first of a few <strong>animated GIFs that contain a hidden Twitter hashtag</strong>. Your job is to discover those hashtags as fast as possible. If your guess for a hashtag is right, search for that hashtag on Twitter and you’ll find a tweet leading you to the next level. Once you’ve reached the last level, just tweet out all the hints in one single tweet to @smashingmag. You're looking for <strong>5 hashtags in total</strong>, a hashtag per level. Not <em>that</em> difficult, right?

So let's get to work. Are you ready? Action!

[![Smashing Mystery](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/97b84684-6803-4ed5-a9bf-734bbe55fe29/find-the-right-path.gif)](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/97b84684-6803-4ed5-a9bf-734bbe55fe29/find-the-right-path.gif) _Hint: watch out for the file name.
