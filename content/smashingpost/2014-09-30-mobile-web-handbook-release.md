## About The Book

We have all been there. Whether you are developing a responsive website or an app or just dealing with WebViews, you always end up running into annoying technical problems that all of those quirky (and not so quirky) mobile browsers throw up so very often. Weird browser bugs, inconsistent **CSS and JavaScript** support, performance issues, mobile fragmentation and complicated nuances such as device pixels, viewports, zooming, touch event cascade, pointer and click events and the 300-millisecond delay. No, mobile **isn’t actually dark matter**, but it _does_ require you to learn a few new things, some of which are quite confusing.</p>

### Why This Book Is For You

Developing websites for mobile is pretty much the same as it has always been, but it does require you to learn a few new things, some of which are quite confusing. In _The Mobile Web Handbook_, you’ll learn the following:

1.  Make sense of the **mobile value chain** of operators and of device and OS vendors.
2.  Distinguish between different **mobile and proxy browsers**, and learn about ongoing browser developments.
3.  See through the complicated browser situation on Android devices.
4.  Understand **CSS pixels**, physical pixels and device pixels.
5.  Make sense of the layout viewport, visual viewport and ideal viewport.
6.  Figure out how **zooming** works and why page zoom is different than pinch zoom.
7.  Learn the intricacies of the **meta viewport** and related CSS and JavaScript properties.
8.  Know how to deal with the technical issues of touch events in JavaScript.
9.  Understand the **touch event cascade** and its bugs.
10.  Handle the **300-millisecond delay**, pointer events and the click event.
11.  Fix common bugs caused by `position: fixed`, `overflow: auto` and `background-attachment`.
12.  Set up a device testing lab and test on mobile.
13.  Reconsider outdated development practices.
14.  Adjust your expectations of **mobile networks** and latency.</p>

<p class="desc"><span class="lead">Summary</span> <span>&bull;</span> Mobile devices have far smaller screens than desktop/laptop computers. As a result, browser vendors had to perform some sleight of hand in order to make sure desktop-optimized websites also display decently. They split the viewport, which on desktop means the browser window, into three. What are these viewports and why do we need them? By discussing <strong>pixels, viewports, resolutions</strong>, the meta viewport, media queries, and related JavaScript events and properties, you'll gain some insight into how mobile browsers (and web developers) deal with the fundamental problem of the small screen.</p>

At first sight, touch events seem to be roughly the same as mouse events. What are the differences? How do they work? Do we need separate events for each interaction mode, or can we merge mouse and touch into one, as Microsoft wants? It is quite likely that future new web-enabled device classes such as TVs, cars, or even fridges, will bring new <strong>interaction modes</strong> and a new set of events.
