## 15 Fresh High-Quality Free Fonts

<a href="https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/fonts/1-junction">Junction</a> [ <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/theleague/fonts/junction.zip?1234204632">Download the .zip-package</a> ]
Designed by Caroline Hadilaksono, Junction is a humanist sans-serif typeface. It has elegant, clearn and very sharp glyphs, but contains only 100 most common symbols. Like <a href="https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;item_id=Gentium">Gentium</a> it perfectly fits to body copy, but can also show its strengths, balance and beauty in headlines. Here are some insights from the designer:

{{% feature-panel %}}

"Inspired by my favorite humanist sans serif typefaces, such as Meta, Myriad, and Scala, Junction is where the best qualities of serif and sans serif typefaces come together. It has the hand drawn and human qualities of a serif, and still retains the clarity and efficiencies of a sans serif typeface. It combines the best of both worlds." Available as OpenType. Released by <a href="https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/">The League of Moveable Type</a>, an open-source type movement.

Neighbourhood Type [ Download the .zip-package ]
"I took Neighbourhood as a challenge to create something that had the graphic expression of a display face while still maintaining some of the functionality of a text face. In the end I created something that I feel has the best of both worlds; an ultra simple sans serif text face with a large set of alternates which when combined with the regular characters create a new graphic display look". Designed by Andy Chung.

Created by Andrea Bergamini, released by <a href="https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/">The League of Moveable Type</a>, an open-source type movement.
