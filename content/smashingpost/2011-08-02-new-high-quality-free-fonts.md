## New High-Quality Free Fonts

Bohema  
Bohema is a unique art-deco typeface with a modern twist. The unpredictability of some glyphs makes it looks original and interesting, although sometimes a bit troublesome. Bohema is available in eight distinct styles and could be a great fit for headlines, editorial lettering, branding, merchandising and special occasions. You can download one weight, Bohema Regular Alternative, for free, although it’s not quite as useful as the rest of the type family.

<a href="https://www.losttype.com/font/?name=highlands">Highlands</a>

<a href="https://www.behance.net/Gallery/Ovalian-Ttpe/321437">Ovalian Type</a>  
An experimental, playful font based on oval and circle shapes. Obviously not a good fit for corporate or elegant projects, but Ovalian Type could be quite useful in projects that invite experimentation, engagement and creativity. Available in TrueType format.

[![Ovalian Type](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/29348a69-5202-4644-828b-2db10af79910/ovalian-font.jpg)](https://www.behance.net/Gallery/Ovalian-Ttpe/321437)

Matilde  
A friendly thin typeface with extra-tall capitals and subtle decorative elements. Matilde would work nicely for headings, short paragraphs, children’s books, posters and brochures. The family contains 212 symbols and glyphs. Two styles are available: Normal and Sketch. The font also contains decorative frames and patterns.

![Matilde Free Font](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/81f69f92-4ca4-4f1e-aa8e-968cde2a775a/matilde-font.jpg)

Banda Typeface  
Banda is a semi-serif typeface characterized by a tall x-height and rounded semi-serifs. Although first designed as a display typeface, Banda quickly evolved into a more complex set, consisting of seven weights plus their respectful italics. Banda can be used for short passages of text as well as fancy displays. Spanning the elegant finesse of the thinner weights to the almost childish bubbliness of the heavier weights, Banda is a great all-round performer, suitable for logos, headlines, packaging and food products and much more.

<a href="https://practicefoundry.com/fabrica.html">Fabrica</a>  
Practice Foundry is an independent foundry that releases fonts under a pay-what-you-want license. The sans-serif font was intended to be the most legible typeface for mobile screens. Its details are drawn from the more systematic constructed Neo-Grotesques, giving it a neutral tone of voice. Although Fabrica was developed primarily for mobile screens, the typeface is suitable to any application, big or small. The font is available in OpenType format for Mac and PC.

<a href="https://arstype.angusrshamal.com/a-new-free-font-ars-novelty/">ARS Novelty</a>  
This typeface is a result of the unconventional approach of Angus R. Shamal. The designer has come up with a fun and by no means less-than-functional experiment in hybrid styles and historical influences, joining the baroque serif with the geometric sans, the formal with the decorative flourish. ARS Novelty is apparently a typeface that tries to make sense of it all. A single weight is available, with stylistic alternates, numerals, standard ligatures and discretionary ligatures, case-sensitive forms, ordinals and localized forms. In OpenType format.

[![ARS Type - A New Free Font](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/b8b5efec-ed47-46e5-bb44-7a5b73323769/ars.jpg)](https://arstype.angusrshamal.com/a-new-free-font-ars-novelty/)

<a href="https://www.google.com/webfonts/family?family=Bevan&amp;subset=latin#download">Bevan</a>

<a href="https://www.designcontest.com/webissimo-font/">Sansus Webissimo</a>  
This typeface is a contemporary open grotesk typeface available in OpenType and TrueType formats. Sansus is a potentially great fit for both headings and body copy, both online and in print. Two font weights are available, regular and italic. The family is released under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License.

[![Sansus Webissimo - contemporary open grotesk](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/083126fb-e83e-4f32-9aee-937ea038b2a5/sansus.png)](https://www.designcontest.com/webissimo-font/)

<a href="https://www.impallari.com/quattrocento/">Quattrocento Roman</a>  
Quattrocento Roman is a classic, elegant and strong typeface that perhaps lacks some maturity in certain details (the “g” and “e,” for example, do not quite seem to fit together). The typeface has wide and open letterforms, and the good x-height makes body text legible even at small sizes. As a classic Roman typeface, Quattrocento is a good choice for big bold headlines. Fontlab source files are included in the download package. Available as a Web font, <a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/quattrocento-sans">Quattrocento Sans</a> is a free download as well.

[![Download Quattrocento Roman font. Impallari.com](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/bd23557a-b30a-4bfe-be00-0cf77d850ce0/quattrocento-screenshot.jpg)](https://www.impallari.com/quattrocento/)

<a href="https://www.impallari.com/dancing/">Dancing Script</a>  
Dancing Script is a lively, casual script whose letters bounce and change in size slightly. The font references popular typefaces from the ’50s. It recalls Murray Hill (by Emil Klumpp, 1956) in its weight distribution and Mistral (by Roger Excoffon, 1953) in its bouncing effect. Dancing Script could be handy if you are looking for a casual, friendly, informal and spontaneous typeface, and it’s a pretty good replacement for Comic Sans, too! Also available as a Web font.

[![Download Dancing Script font. Impallari.com](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/cd319183-fe7c-4718-9219-6f12f91ad8f9/dancing-script-screenshot.jpg)](https://www.impallari.com/dancing/)

<a href="https://www.impallari.com/cabin/">Cabin</a>  
Cabin is a humanist sans serif inspired by Edward Johnston and Eric Gill’s typefaces, with a touch of modernism. Cabin incorporates modern proportions, optical adjustments and some elements of the geometric sans. As the designer puts it, “It remains true to its roots, but has its own personality.” An excellent typeface for body copy and headings on small and large screens. Four font weights are available, with corresponding italic styles.

[![Download Cabin font. Impallari.com](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/597269e9-4d15-46f2-ba5b-50c8107af016/cabin.jpg)](https://www.impallari.com/cabin/)

<a href="https://ospublish.constantvzw.org/foundry/logisoso/">Logisoso</a>  
Logisoso is an ongoing type design project. Created during a signage project for a logistics center, where it was used to identify different buildings, the font was later completed with Inkscape and generated with FontForge. The download package contains the source files for you to improve and optimize the font.

<a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/New-freeware-font-Novecento/1454313">Novecento</a>  
Novecento is an uppercase-only font family inspired by the European typographic trends of the first half of 20th century. The typeface looks rational, geometric and blocky. But it is based on optical, not geometric, proportions. Novecento could be used for headlines, visual identities and short sentences. The lighter weights provide a more contemporary look and feel, while the bolder ones have a retro flavor.

[![Novecento Free Font](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/263fee02-d18a-465a-98bf-49020f2374b0/novecento-font.jpg)](https://www.behance.net/gallery/New-freeware-font-Novecento/1454313)

This font was created by Oleg Zhuravlev and is meant for illustrations that display your brainstorming and other creative ideas.

The font contains 151 glyphs, including Latin and Cyrillic alphabets, numerals and some special characters.

[![Free Font: Five Minutes](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/aa500913-9c2e-481e-971e-682ab40fad8c/5minutes-font.jpg)](https://freetypography.com/2011/01/17/free-font-five-minutes/)

Maven Pro  
Maven Pro is a free sans-serif typeface with a unique curvature and flowing rhythm. The extensive collection of characters totals over 530 glyphs! Many languages are supported (too many to list), including basic Latin and Western European diacritics. The vast number of glyphs make it highly usable for just about any textual content: spreadsheets, documents and especially websites.
