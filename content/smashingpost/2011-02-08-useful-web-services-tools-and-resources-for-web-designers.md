  We know how hard it is to find good useful tools that all of your developers and designers out there spend hours searching for. And for that reason, we're regularly collecting useful online web services, tools and resources — little time-savers that can boost every designer's workflow and save time that would otherwise be required for mundane tasks.
categories:
  - Coding

  - Resources

You might have seen some of these tools in [our Twitter stream](https://twitter.com/smashingmag) or on [our Facebook page](https://facebook.com/smashmag), but certainly not all of them. We've prepared the most useful ones (yet not necessarily the most beautiful ones) in this handy overview for your convenience. Please share any further tools with us and our readers in the comments to this post. As usual, we express sincere gratitude to all designers and developers out there who create, maintain and improve these tools as their little side projects. You really make the difference, guys. Thank you.

You may want to check out our previous round-up, [Time-Saving and Educational Resources for Web Designers](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/01/18/time-saving-and-educational-resources-for-web-designers/), as well.</p>

## Useful Web Services, Tools and Resources

[FontFuse: Gallery of Font Pairings](https://fontfuse.webink.com)  
FontFuse is a font pairing design resource that displays font pairings and hence helps you compare and choose fonts. You can browse through fonts as well as font families, and explore the most recent, most popular and contest-leading font pairings.

[Little Big UI Details](https://littlebigdetails.com/)  
This site features tiny details that improve the user experience of websites and mobile apps. You'll find some useful design techniques found by your colleagues across the Web. Also, share your favorite little things on the website as well. The collection is already very useful, with more design examples submitted every single day.

[A Sampler Page](https://www.alistapart.com/articles/a-simpler-page/)  
While physical books are traditionally well defined and structured objects, digital books live on screens that vary greatly in their dimensions. In this _A List Apart_ article, Craig Mod dives into the similarities and differences of these media and presents the baseline for designers who want to produce beautiful and readable text on a tablet.

[Readability: Enjoy Reading, Support Writing](https://www.readability.com/)  
Another handy little helper that gets rid of the unwanted clutter. Readability allows you to choose your preferred settings (font size, margin and style) and applies them to any website. Drag the bookmarklet with your saved settings into your bookmars bar or folder, visit the website of your choice, click on the bookmarklet and you get a good, comfortable read. Besides, readability offers a way to compensate writers and publishers without punishing readers. 70% of all membership fees go directly to the people who make the content.

People can use it as a bookmarklet, pulling it into the Favorites toolbar of their browser and clicking as needed.

Sometimes it removes too much content, though, such as readers' comments. If you'd like an alternative, give <a href="https://www.web2pdfconvert.com/">Web2PDF</a> or Notforest a try.</p>
<p class="showcase"><a href="https://joliprint.com"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/29de2e7d-6dab-478a-aad9-81a9c306b0bf/jolly.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="500" height="397" /></a></p>

<p>Entitifier<br />Cleaning up text for the Web can be time-consuming and prone to error. But if a client delivers content in Microsoft Word or a similar format, then cleaning it up is a necessary evil if you don't want to end up with characters that don't display properly online. Entitifier does the hard work for you. All you have to do is enter HTML or text, and it escapes nasty characters that should be entities. Just don't enter text with inline PHP or HTML5 tags, because the tool doesn't work well with them yet.

<p><a href="https://superuser.com/questions/235937/does-email-address-obfuscation-actually-work">The Email Address Obfuscation Debate</a><br />Superuser has an interesting discussion about <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/235937/does-email-address-obfuscation-actually-work">email obfuscation</a>, with opinions from a number of users. Included also are different techniques for accomplishing obfuscation, empirical data about its effectiveness and links to other discussions and articles. One interesting technique is to use the obscure <code>unicode-bidi</code> and <code>direction</code> CSS properties and write the email address backwards: for example, <code>moc.elpmaxe@zyx</code>. Plenty of interesting ideas worth learning and discussing. (cc)</p>

Quick CSV Data Convertor<br />As Web designers, we constantly receive data in Excel and other spreadsheet formats. This works fine when you just need to view the data on your computer. But when you need to upload it to and display it on the client's website, it becomes a huge pain. This tool takes a CSV or tab-delimited file in Excel and converts it to JSON, XML, ActionScript and other Web-friendly formats instantly. If you want to convert your spreadsheet data to HTML, you might want to give <a href="https://tableizer.journalistopia.com/">Tableizer</a> a try.
