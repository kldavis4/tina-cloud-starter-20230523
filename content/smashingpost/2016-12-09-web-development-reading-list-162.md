  We shouldn’t let ourselves get distracted by people who work on different
  projects than we do. If a developer advocate works on a web-based QR code
  application, for example, their way of tackling things most certainly won’t
  fit your project. If someone builds a real-time dashboard, their concept won’t
  relate to the company portfolio website you’re building. Bear in mind that
  **_you_ need to find the best concept**, the best technologies, the best
  solution for _your_ specific project.

  Thinking about the right decisions rather than following cool, new trends
  blindly, is the first step to building **responsible web solutions**. That’s
  what we call _progressive enhancement_. The only subjective matter in this
  undertaking is you, judging what level of progressive enhancement a solution
  should have.

## News

*   Angular 1.x users, here’s version 1.6 for you. Todd Motto shares [what’s new in the version](https://toddmotto.com/angular-1-6-is-here) and how to migrate easily.
*   The [new Microsoft Edge build](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/changelog/desktop/14986/) features support for Brotli, for CSS Custom Properties, as well as async/await. DOM performance has also been improved.</p>

## General

*   Aaron Gustafson wrote a thoughtful piece on why [progressive enhancement is not an anti-JavaScript concept](https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/insert-clickbait-headline-about-progressive-enhancement-here/) but a concept of finding the best way to adapt to the nature of the web. It’s a subtle, inclusive concept that takes the environment and its quirks into account.
*   Pusher created [a space for videos of front-end talks](https://pusher.com/sessions). There are some great ones available that you can watch for free.

## Concept & Design

*   [Microsoft’s Inclusive Design guidelines](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/design/inclusive) and resources are very helpful to understand how you as a company can take advantage of creating an inclusive product by design.</p>

## Web Performance

*   Tim Kadlec [describes](https://calendar.perfplanet.com/2016/meet-the-web-worldwide/) what a new project called “[The Web, Worldwide](https://www.webworldwide.io/)” is about and why it’s important for developers and project owners to understand the role of the Internet in various markets. I wrote a similar post this week about [choosing browser support in a project](https://helloanselm.com/2016/the-world-uses-the-internet/) and why we’re often doing it wrong because we base our assumptions on misleading data.</p>

## HTML & SVG

*   [These fun statistics on HTML and SVG usage](https://css-tricks.com/random-interesting-facts-htmlsvg-usage/) are really insightful. By analyzing eight million websites, some interesting facts could be discovered: `href="javascript:void(0)"`, for example, is still used massively, and `span.button` can also be found in a lot of codebases.</p>

## JavaScript

*   Unfortunately, there’s no further source to back up this statement, but Domenic Denicola found out that the [Filesystem API might be removed from the specification](https://mobile.twitter.com/domenic/status/806281944849784832) as it turned out that it’s used for incognito mode detection in browsers in 95% of the use cases.
*   The parallax effect isn’t going away anytime soon, so if we need to make use of it, we should at least do it in the most effective, most performant way. [Paul Lewis shares how to achieve that](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/12/performant-parallaxing).
*   Remy Sharp reports how he got started with React.js and how he finally made [Server Side React](https://remysharp.com/2016/12/07/server-side-react) work in his project.

## Work & Life

*   Holger Bartel wrote about [the value of attending conferences](https://foobartel.com/articles/value-of-conferences) and how different things are in Asia, for example, when compared to other parts of the world.

_And with that, I’ll close for this week. If you like what I write each week, please [support me with a donation](https://wdrl.info/donate) or share this resource with other people. You can learn more [about the costs of the project here](https://wdrl.info/costs/). It’s available via email, RSS and online._
