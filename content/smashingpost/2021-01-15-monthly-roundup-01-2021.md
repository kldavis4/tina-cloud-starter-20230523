With the new year sinking in and everyone’s resolutions still being put to the test, we are slowly returning back to our day-to-day projects. And as we do so, we focus on the new targets for 2021: improving accessibility, conversion, engagement, retention, and of course <strong>web performance</strong>. We all have different personal goals for this year, but one thing unites us all: improving the web for everyone.

The time between the years is always a great time to calm down; but it’s also a wonderful time to do some reseach, thinking, writing and perhaps even unsolicited coding and designining. And almost as if it was an annual tradition (it actually is), Vitaly has been reading through everything that happened in <strong>front-end in 2021</strong>, and compiling it all in the <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/01/front-end-performance-2021-free-pdf-checklist/">front-end performance checklist 2021</a> yet again.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://twitter.com/katiehempenius/status/1075478356311924737" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/949e5601-04e7-48ee-91a5-10bd7af19a0f/perf-budgets-network-connection.jpg" sizes="100vw" caption="From the <a href='https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/01/front-end-performance-2021-free-pdf-checklist/'>Front-End Performance Checklist 2021</a>: performance budgets should adapt depending on the network conditions for an average mobile device.

This guide covers pretty much everything you need to build <strong>fast experiences on the web</strong> today &mdash; from metrics to tooling and front-end techniques and strategies. It has proved to be quite useful to many readers in the past years, so hopefully it will be useful for you, too. You can also edit the checklist (<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/34noajrbm324iai/performance-checklist-1.4.pdf?dl=0">PDF</a>, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/s7ctdj89zd5zlvtt7dkhi/performance-checklist-1.4.docx?dl=0&rlkey=2xzs55e3kdg1jcraw5u1tnpl8">MS Word Doc</a> and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ikuk5ikcxxv39uu/performance-checklist-1.4.pages?dl=0">Apple Pages</a>) and adjust it to your own personal needs, or even use it for your organization.

Now, without further ado, let’s take a look at what the Smashing team has in store for you in the next months.

## Plan Your Year Ahead With Online Workshops

Have you attended <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/10/how-we-run-smashing-online-workshops/">one of our workshops</a> yet? We are thrilled each and every time we run <strong>practical, online workshops</strong> with all of the wonderful attendees from all over the world coming together to learn together. It has proved to be a great opportunity to connect with people around the world, and share experiences live. So many ideas have been brought to life thanks to the [live design and coding sessions](https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/), and there are many folks that have found new friends, too!

## New: Smashing Online Audits on Front-End & UX

<p>
<a href="https://smashingconf.com/online-audits/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" style="float:right;margin-top:1em;margin-left:1.5em;margin-bottom:1em;border-radius:11px;max-width:50%" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/51522c11-0765-4a0b-be43-cbf89750fe79/topple-wizard.svg" width="200" alt="Topple the Cat dressed up as a wizard" /></a>Just last week we’ve silently launched our new little product &mdash; <a href="https://smashingconf.com/online-audits/">online audits</a> &mdash; 30–60 mins video review along with a written report of our findings. It’s a simple quick way to validate your ideas and get an <strong>honest, unbiased feedback</strong> (for now just from Vitaly) on the front-end & UX of your website, app, or mock-ups. Plus, guidelines and action points to do better.</p>

<p><a href="https://smashingconf.com/online-audits/">Book an audit of your choice</a> and share some details about your website, app, or mock-ups, and we’ll get back to you in almost no time!</p>

## Smashing Podcast: Tune In And Get Inspired

Last year, we’ve published a new [Smashing Podcast](https://podcast.smashingmagazine.com/episodes) episode every two weeks, and the feedback has been *awesome*! With over 56k downloads (just over a thousand per week, and growing!), we’ve had 34 guests on the podcast with different backgrounds and <em>so</em> much to share!

If you don’t see a topic you’d like to hear and learn more about, please don’t hesitate to reach out to host [Drew McLellan](https://twitter.com/drewm) or <a href="https://twitter.com/SmashingPod">get in touch via Twitter</a> anytime &mdash; we’d love to hear from you!

## Smashing Newsletter: Best Picks

<p><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-smashing-newsletter/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" style="float:right;margin-top:1em;margin-left:1.5em;margin-bottom:1em;border-radius:11px;max-width:50%" src="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/images/smashing-cat/cat-with-slippers.svg" width="200" alt="The weekly Smashing Newsletter" /></a>With our <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-smashing-newsletter/">weekly newsletter</a>, we aim to bring you <strong>useful, practical tidbits</strong> and share some of the helpful things that folks are working on in the web industry. There are <em>so</em> many talented folks out there working on brilliant projects, and we’d appreciate it if you could help spread the word and give them the credit they deserve!<br /><br />Also, <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-smashing-newsletter/">by subscribing</a>, there are no third-party mailings or hidden advertising, and your support really helps us pay the bills. ❤️</p>

<p><em>Interested in sponsoring? Feel free to check out our <a href="https://smashingmagazine.com/provide/SmashingMag_SmashingConf_Partnership_2020.pdf">partnership options</a> and <a href="mailto:&#97;&#100;&#118;&#101;&#114;&#116;&#105;&#115;&#105;&#110;&#103;&#64;&#115;&#109;&#97;&#115;&#104;&#105;&#110;&#103;&#109;&#97;&#103;&#97;&#122;&#105;&#110;&#101;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">get in touch</a> with the team anytime &mdash; they’ll be sure to get back to you as soon as they can.</em></p>

<p>Below are some of the <strong>popular newsletter pieces</strong> that we’ve shared in our newsletter recently:</p>

### Default Local Fonts Compatibility

<p>Default fonts vary significantly across different operating systems. To provide an easy way to look up a system’s default fonts, especially the ones that need to be available through CSS <code>font-family</code>, Zach Leatherman built <a href="https://fontfamily.io/">Font Family Reunion</a>.</p>

{{< rimg href="https://fontfamily.io/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/3a203df5-dd4f-4c58-9085-a30654262185/font-family-reunion.png" sizes="100vw" caption="" alt="Font Family Reunion" >}}

<p>The compatibility table works like a <em>Can I Use</em> for default local fonts: Once you enter a <code>font-family</code>, it will tell you if it is supported, as well es what the five standard CSS keyword font-families (<code>serif</code>, <code>sans-serif</code>, <code>monospace</code>, and the lesser known <code>fantasy</code> and <code>cursive</code>) are aliased to in each operating system. One for the bookmarks.</p>

### Improving Google Fonts Performance

<p>Self-hosting fonts is widely accepted to be the fastest option when using web fonts. However, Google Fonts can be speedy, too: their ability to serve the tiniest possible font files to specific user agents and platforms and their relatively new support for <code>font-display</code> via the URL parameter <code>&amp;display=swap</code> are already a good base. And, <a href="https://csswizardry.com/2020/05/the-fastest-google-fonts/">as Harry Roberts shows</a>, there are quite some things that you can do to improve their performance even further and mitigate a lot of the issues that Google Fonts are commonly known for.</p>

{{< rimg href="https://csswizardry.com/2020/05/the-fastest-google-fonts/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/cb366dea-ff25-4562-b668-e5bfc3e266c2/fastest-google-fonts.png" sizes="100vw" caption="" alt="The Fastest Google Fonts" >}}

<p>For his article “<a href="https://csswizardry.com/2020/05/the-fastest-google-fonts/">The Fastest Google Fonts</a>,” Harry went down the performance testing rabbit hole to find the best combination for fast Google Fonts: asynchronously loading CSS, asynchronously loading font files, opting into FOFT, fast-fetching asynchronous CSS files, and warming up external domains. All of these techniques combined might sound a bit overwhelming at first, but Harry concludes his article with a slim and maintainable snippet that helps you get the most out of Google Fonts.</p>

### Responsive Emails Made Easy

<p>Coding clean, responsive emails that provide a solid experience in all popular email clients can be a time-consuming challenge. <a href="https://heml.io/">HEML</a> is here to change that. The open-source markup language gives you the native power of HTML without having to deal with all of the email quirks. There are no special rules or styling paradigms to master, so if you know HTML and CSS, you are ready to start.</p>

{{< rimg href="https://mjml.io/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ad3a78a9-eb06-454e-83e9-3874780df1d4/mjml-preview.png" sizes="100vw" caption="" alt="MJML" >}}

<p><a href="https://mjml.io/">MJML</a> is based on the same idea of simplifying the process of creating responsive emails. The markup language is based on a semantic syntax that makes the process straightforward while an open-source engine does the heavy lifting and translates the MJML you wrote into responsive HTML. A library of standard components saves you extra time and lightens your email code base. And if you want to build your own, <a href="https://blocksedit.com/email-template-guide/">Modular Template System Guide</a> might help, too. Promising!</p>

### Bulletproof HTML Email Templates

<p>Making an HTML email work across email clients ain’t an easy task. Fortunately, there are plenty of reliable tools, templates and frameworks to make it easier to get your work done. For example, <a href="https://maizzle.com/">Maizzle</a> is a framework that helps you quickly build HTML emails with Tailwind CSS and advanced, email-specific post-processing. It also provides a few ready-made projects (Maizzle Starters) that you can start with right away.</p>

{{< rimg href="https://maizzle.com/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/28e32934-4379-4198-be32-a56a13052e98/illustration-folks-email-templates.png" sizes="100vw" caption="" alt="Bulletproof HTML Email Templates" >}}

<p><a href="https://tedgoas.github.io/Cerberus/">Cerberus</a> and <a href="https://htmlemail.io/">HTML Email</a> provide small collections of reliable, solid patterns for responsive HTML emails that are well-tested in 50+ email clients, including Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, AOL, and many others. <a href="https://emailframe.work/">EmailFrame.work</a> allows you to build responsive HTML email templates with pre-built grid options and basic components, supported in over 60+ email clients.</p>
<p><a href="https://stripo.email/templates/">Stripo</a>, <a href="https://chamaileon.io/">Chamaileon</a>, <a href="https://designmodo.com/postcards/">Postcards</a>, <a href="https://topol.io/">Topol.io</a> and <a href="https://beefree.io/">Bee Free</a> feature plenty of free HTML email templates, Litmus provides <a href="https://litmus.com/resources/free-responsive-email-templates">Responsive Email Templates</a> for newsletters, product updates and receipts, and CampaignMonitor has a <a href="https://www.campaignmonitor.com/email-templates/">free HTML email template builder</a> with drag’n’drop functionality.</p>

### From CSS Gradients To Fake Data

<p>Imagine that you just need to find CSS triangle styles for elements and pseudo-elements. Or perhaps refine the color palette a bit by exploring <strong>tints and shades</strong> of a given color. Or perhaps generate a linear and radial CSS gradient for a section of the page. There is no need to do it all manually or try to find those CSS snippets all over the web. You can always find them on <a href="https://omatsuri.app/">Omatsuri</a>.</p>

{{< rimg href="https://omatsuri.app/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0d65988a-7e10-4b2e-a374-de9fc1e1f3d8/color-shades-gradient-generator.jpg" sizes="100vw" caption="" alt="From CSS Gradients To Fake Data" >}}

<p>Omatsuri means <em>festival</em> in Japanese, and the site is a lovely little festival of open-source browser tools for everyday use. On the site, you’ll find a triangle generator, a color shades generator, a gradient generator, page dividers, SVG compressor, <strong>SVG → JSX converter</strong>, a fake data generator, CSS cursors, and keyboard event codes. Designed and built by Vitaly Rtishchev and Vlad Shilov. The <a href="https://github.com/rtivital/omatsuri">source code of the site</a> is available as well.</p>

### CSS Shadow Generator

<p>Looking for a tool that’ll automatically generate CSS code for really <strong>smooth, layered box-shadows</strong>? Well, you’re going to love <a href="https://brumm.af/shadows">SmoothShadow</a>. Inspired by an article written by <a href="https://tobiasahlin.com/blog/layered-smooth-box-shadows/">Tobias Ahlin Bjerrome</a>, this nifty tool was created to help anyone generate the code they need on the spot.</p>

<p>Once you’ve given it a try, it will be difficult to not use it. The little tool allows you to visually design a layered smooth box-shadow, but also tweak alpha, offset and blur with individual easing curves. And it gets even better: The creator of the tool, <a href="https://twitter.com/funkensturm">Philipp Brumm</a>, has also released SmoothShadow as a <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/788830704169694737/SmoothShadow">Figma plugin</a>, so you can optimize your workflow just like you’ve always wanted to!</p>

### Understanding CSS Variables

<p>CSS variables are powerful. They cascade normally, inherit, make it possible to reuse code, and they are extremely permissive. But what can you actually put in a CSS variable to make full use of its potential? Since some of the things aren’t that obvious, Will Boyd explored the possibilities in a <a href="https://codersblock.com/blog/what-can-you-put-in-a-css-variable/">blog post</a>.</p>

{{< rimg href="https://codersblock.com/blog/what-can-you-put-in-a-css-variable/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c568f076-a955-4b9a-a9bf-2ff015a2fe1d/abstract-image-colorful-bowls.png" sizes="100vw" caption="" alt="What Can You Put in a CSS Variable?" >}}

<p>From unit values to pre-defined keywords, content strings, images, and even fancy animated values, Will’s summary shines a light on the most common things that you might want to use in combination with a CSS variable. A great overview.</p>

### Never Stop Learning

<p>The learning never stops. And since it’s often the little insights, code tidbits, and tips that turn out to be the most useful, Stefan Judis started “<a href="https://www.stefanjudis.com/today-i-learned/">Today I Learned</a>”.</p>

{{< rimg href="https://www.samanthaming.com/tidbits/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/dc2a5a61-2976-4a0d-a7a9-a20a3c91b84e/samantha-ming-code-tidbits-preview-example.png" sizes="100vw" caption="" alt="Code Tidbits" >}}

<p>Whether it’s the awareness that SVG filters can be inlined in CSS or how to tell browsers that your site supports color schemes, for each little thing he learned, Stefan shares a brief summary &mdash; not only related to CSS but also accessibility, bash, git, GraphQL, HTML, JavaScript, and much more. Samantha Ming’s <a href="https://www.samanthaming.com/tidbits/">code tidbits</a> are also a treasure chest of quick but invaluable web dev wisdom that is bound to make your live easier.</p>
