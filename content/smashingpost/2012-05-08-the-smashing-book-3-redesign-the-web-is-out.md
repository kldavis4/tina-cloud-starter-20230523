## Why The Theme Of “Redesign”?

In recent years, the Web has changed—a _lot_. The Web designer’s tools are now advanced, and browsers are highly capable. Designers have established clever coding and design techniques, and they face new challenges and are embracing new technologies. These changes are fundamental and require us to reconsider how we approach Web design. It’s time to rethink and reinvent: **it is time to redesign the Web**. The new Smashing books will change the way you design websites for the better.

But are we all prepared for this? How does responsive design fit into your workflow? What UX and mobile techniques do you follow when designing websites? And if you have a redesign project on the horizon, how do you approach it and work your way through it? The books explain what you need to know in order to create effective websites today, and what you need to know to be prepared for the future. Well-known experts share practical know-how and introduce a whole new mindset for progressive, future-proof Web design.

<figure class="gra"><a title="The Smashing Book #3" href="https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/smashing-book-3-printed-and-or-ebook.html"><img alt="The Smashing Book #3" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8d3d4416-7708-4cfe-9fd5-6a2dd049da03/redthewebbig.png" width="250" height="auto" /></a></figure>

With over 40 people having worked on the project, a lot of thorough editing and consideration needed to be done to fine-tune each chapter's content and order to make the most sense. In the end, 11 of the most outstanding articles made it into the Smashing Book #3, covering topics ranging from the business side of design to mobile approaches and responsive design.

The **Smashing Book #3** covers innovative coding, design and UX techniques and discusses the peculiarities of the mobile context and emotional design. It also presents practical HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript techniques, as well as a bulletproof workflow for responsive Web design. The book challenges you to think differently about your work, your code and your designs.</p>

<td>The Business Side of Redesign</td>
<td><div class="arrow"></div></td>

<tr>
<td colspan="3">A redesign is the best thing that a Web designer can experience. Yet before leaping head on into a project, we must consider the business behind the redesign. By its nature, a redesign has the potential to make a website successful, but it also has the power to destroy a perfectly good idea. Important considerations to keep in mind before engaging in a redesign project include common dangers, required research, the working process with the client and testing. Paul Boag leads you through this process step by step.<strong>Chapter keywords:</strong> <em>business model, redesign timing, scope of redesign, redesign considerations, realignment, project pitfalls.</em></td>

<td>Selecting a Platform for Redesign</td>
<td><div class="arrow"></div></td>

<tr>
<td colspan="3">Once you have understood the business side of the redesign project, the next step is to choose the right platform. Understanding all of the requirements of a project will save you valuable time in aligning the new functionality with the technological circumstances. Take stock of existing structures such as the CMS, e-commerce system and payment gateway. Beware of the project constraints, including the budget and wishes of the client. Only then will you be able to concentrate fully on the project, without encountering unpleasant surprises ahead.<strong>Chapter keywords:</strong> <em>technical requirements, CMS, eCommerce, payment gateway, refactoring, platform choice, redesign project constraints.</em></td>

<td colspan="3">Ben Schwarz takes away the fear that many Web developers suffer when confronted with a new technology—by encouraging experimentation. The chapter guides you through the new HTML5 elements and discusses the possibilities that come with the adaptation to these elements.

<td colspan="3">User experience means good design, and the central aim of design is not to decorate, but to solve problems. Whether that means getting more sign-ups, inviting users to post more content or making the interface easier and faster to use, this is ultimately the sort of design that delivers a great user experience. This chapter features powerful UX techniques that you can easily apply to your products and websites. Make sure users stay on your website for the right reasons, and get an edge over the competition by improving user-targeted processes. Also, explore experimental approaches and avoid some misleading design techniques.<strong>Chapter keywords:</strong> <em>UX design, forms, good defaults, customer service, copywriting, storytelling, experimental techniques, design pitfalls.</em></td>

We have to continually change our tools and techniques to meet new requirements. Marc Edwards addresses some of the challenges that Web designers face today and will in the future when using Photoshop. Realism, scale, screen sizes, resolutions, formats, techniques—this chapter touches on all of it.

Getting to know your user is just as important as knowing yourself and the personality behind the brand; this will set you apart from competitors. This chapter describes how to develop your own design persona and define the key characteristics to guide your project’s path. New technologies and techniques are not what build connections with users, but rather the empathy evoked by the personality behind them. Aaron Walter explains how to bring out the personality at the heart of your work.<strong>Chapter keywords:</strong> <em>personality, brand sympathy, engagement methods, design persona, voice and tone.</em></td>

<td colspan="3">The native vs. Web debate is meaningless and counterproductive. All products nowadays have high demands for UX design. Web designers turn into UX designers by gaining specialized knowledge of the Web and by mastering auxiliary frameworks and their components. Not only do the aesthetics of an interaction object count, but also how the object behaves upon contact. Designing documents and designing applications requires knowledge of basic responsive design principles and progressive enhancement. This chapter helps you understand your medium, explains what exactly it means for an application to be “native,” and goes over how to choose the right tools and technologies for the job.<strong>Chapter keywords:</strong> <em>mobile, user experience, native applications, native as culture, interaction design principles, responsive Web design.</em></td>

How do you go about integrating as many devices as possible? Is targeting as many different platforms as possible really important?

A new way of thinking leads to a new way of design—the sooner you get the hang of it, the sooner you will be ready to discover what works best for your projects.<strong>Chapter keywords:</strong> <em>responsive Web design, device-agnostic approach, content inventory, future-friendly approach, breakpoint graphing, designing in the browser.</em></td>

With Web design, we can do much more than inform the audience. The power of storytelling and content strategy is in creating engaging, emotional connections that transcend their platform. In this book, we will review emerging navigation design patterns and understand how to employ a content strategy—which is an important process, often underestimated, and dependent on many factors.

**Smashing Book 3⅓**, otherwise known as “The Extension,” presents practical applications of storytelling to Web design, reviews emerging navigation design patterns and helps you understand how to meaningfully employ content strategy on your websites. A case study of Smashing Magazine’s responsive redesign illustrates how this approach could look like in practice.

## Cover Design by Veerle Pieters

The Smashing Book series has gotten a rather eye-catching facelift. The well-respected Belgian artist [Veerle Pieters](https://veerle.duoh.com/) has taken on the significant task of putting together an innovative, bold cover design. And the result is bold indeed. Veerle’s styling of Smashing Magazine’s “S” reflects the many aspects that make up a Web designer’s workflow today.</p>

<figure class="fwi"><img alt="Screenshot" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/88b29f5b-feca-4f21-82f7-0384cbdadafa/smb3-small.jpg" /><figcaption>An excerpt of Veerle’s final cover design for the Smashing Book #3.</figcaption></figure>

## Exclusive Artwork by Kate McLelland

If you have the Smashing Book 2, you’ll know that animals play a distinct role—forming almost a tradition for the series. This time, we have asked the talented young illustrator [Kate McLelland](https://www.katemclelland.co.uk/) to illustrate the introductory pages for all of the chapters. Kate has been impressively creative in her designs; the theme of redesign has obviously shaped the tone of her artwork. Each chapter begins with an elaborate drop cap.</p>

<figure class="fwi"><a href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/9fd1fe3c-01ee-44ad-90f6-ec41a4024c72/letter-g.png"><img title="A detail of a chapter illustration, designed by Kate McLelland." alt="A detail of a chapter illustration, designed by Kate McLelland." src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/96a589a3-e259-42a1-8f96-ecc2074649b0/letter-g1.png" /></a></figure>

<figure class="fwi"><img alt="Chapter Design" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/518565f0-e113-4f5d-a0c8-3fc012af8b16/letter-w.png" width="500" height="410" /><figcaption>A detail of a chapter illustration, designed by Kate McLelland.</figcaption></figure>

Each illustration employs a different metaphor that relates to the accompanying chapter. See what they all are once you get your hands on the book. Appropriately enough, when strung together, the drop caps spell out “Redesign the Web.” The composite style of the illustrations points to how so many components have to come together for a successful redesign.</p>

## Please Spread The Word!

These new books took seven months of production time, from brainstorming to delivery; 43 people worked on the content, design, layout, editing and proofreading of the book; 623 animals are hidden in various places in the Smashing Book #3; and the production costs for initial circulation, excluding marketing costs, required a six-figure budget. That’s what it took us to ensure that our Berlin warehouses are stocked with these new valuable books, waiting to be shipped right away as soon as you place your order.

Here at Smashing Magazine, we do our best to support and enrich the design community. Yet **we also rely heavily on community opinion**—in fact, the magazine would not be what it is today without the constant feedback of the community. That's where you come in: we now pass the book onto you.
