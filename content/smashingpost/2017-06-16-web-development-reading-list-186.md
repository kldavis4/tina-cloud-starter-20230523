  Design is **one of the most controversial things in our industry**. There are
  barely any redesigns that aren’t discussed heavily in the community. Changing
  a well-working design is even harder as people tend to dislike anything new,
  but if we give them a bit of time, they might start to see things from a
  different perspective.

  Instead of following what everyone else is doing, we shouldn’t hesitate to
  leave the beaten tracks when designing — by creating a contrast-rich, deep
  design without using drop shadows, for example. Whatever you do, be sure to
  explore new options whenever you can.

## News

*   [Chrome 60 beta is available](https://blog.chromium.org/2017/06/chrome-60-beta-paint-timing-api-css.html) and brings us the Paint Timing API, CSS’ `font-display` property, the Web Budget API, and Credential Management API improvements.
*   [Firefox 54 is out](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/06/firefox-54-e10s-webextension-apis-css-clip-path/) — and, thanks to a new multi-process architecture, with huge performance improvements. The update also [brings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/54) us the new Web Extension APIs as well as CSS clip-path improvements with basic shapes.
*   A new version of Tor Browser was released, too: [Tor Browser 7.0](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-70-released). The new version is based on Firefox 52 ESR and, thus, has multi-process mode and sandboxing on Linux and macOS (Windows coming soon) enabled.

## Concept & Design

*   Matej Latin created an [online course to teach you better web typography in ten free lessons](https://betterwebtype.com/).
*   Scott Jensen shows how you can [create great designs with depth without using drop shadows](https://scottjensen.design/2017/05/out-of-the-dropshadows/). A great primer on modern design techniques.

## Security

*   Patrick Wardle found evidence that there’s a macOS ransomware spreading and [wrote up the key facts about it](https://objective-see.com/blog/blog_0x1E.html). This shows that the Mac platform is growing and attackers start targeting users as well. Better be safe and have a valid, usable backup.</p>

## Work & Life

*   Last but not least, an article that makes us rethink how we deal with our workloads: Madeleine Dore’s “[Why you should manage your energy, not your time](https://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20170612-why-you-should-manage-your-energy-not-your-time).”
