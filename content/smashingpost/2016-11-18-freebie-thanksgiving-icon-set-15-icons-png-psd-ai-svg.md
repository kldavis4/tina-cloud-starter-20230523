  With Thanksgiving coming up next week, have you already thought about ways how
  to spend your days before the holiday? Well, you could send simple "Thank You"

  take some time to improve your website. To those of you who celebrate
  Thanksgiving, we've got a nice icon set for you today — all available in PNG,
  PSD, AI and SVG formats.

  This set of 15 free icons was created by the design team at _ucraft_. Please
