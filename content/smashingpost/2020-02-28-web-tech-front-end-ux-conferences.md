Hello again! :-) It has been a while since I've updated this list. It seems like events are slowly coming together again. So welcome back to conferences and enjoy the company of peers. Make sure to have an eye on covid policies for individual events. These may differ from event to event.

So you can learn at your own pace, in your own time, and follow interactive exercises along the way.
