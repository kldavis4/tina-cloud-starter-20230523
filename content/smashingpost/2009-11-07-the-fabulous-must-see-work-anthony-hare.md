  Once in a while, I'll be browsing the internet and would run into an artist
  that would just make me say, "WOW!" Well, **Anthony Hare is one of them**.
  This man has mastered the art of black and white illustrations. You absolutely
  need to see his work. I like his work very much. It is very clean, and the
  lines are sharp and crisp. **Another thing that amazes me is not only the
  quality of his work, but the quantity of it as well.** Anthony has tons of
  pieces in his portfolio and they are all really nice. You need to check out
  his portfolio site [here](https://www.siteway.com/).

  Anyways, enough of me talking and more of you viewing. Go ahead and check out
  20 of his illustrations that I have included here.
