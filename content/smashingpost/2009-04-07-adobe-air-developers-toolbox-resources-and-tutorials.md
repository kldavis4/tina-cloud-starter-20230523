  Originally called Apollo, **Adobe Air** was released in beta back in 2007 and has gone from strength to strength ever since. You can build an Adobe Air app using HTML, JavaScript, Flash or ActionScript relatively simply. Basically anyone with even a little knowledge of programming and a little patience can create rich Internet applications.

Below, we present the <strong>Adobe AIR Developer’s Toolbox: Resources and Tutorials</strong>, a round-up of tutorials, links, references, cheat sheets and showcases that will help you create the next popular app.</p>

## What is AIR and How To Get Started?

First things first: Adobe Integrated Runtime (AIR) is a <strong>cross-platform runtime environment for building rich Internet applications</strong> using Adobe Flash, Adobe Flex, HTML, or Ajax, that can be deployed as a desktop application. The runtime bridges the "classic" user experience within Web-applications and rich, highly sophisticated user experience in modern desktop-applications.

<a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/air/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/98ff47c1-738b-4ee9-8b70-4f7ea4d34e38/adobeairtoolox1.jpg" alt="Adobe AIR Toolbox" width="480" height="187" /></a>

To do so, the runtime complements the browser adding desktop integration, local data access, embedded database, convenient desktop APIs and a cross-operating system compatibility. In other words, Adobe Air makes it possible for web-developers to run rich Internet applcations outside the web browser (similar to Mozilla's Prism) – on the desktop – and also guarantess <strong>cross-compatibility</strong> across operating systems. Hence, applications are created using a mixture of JavaScript, HTML, and Flash. The resulting application is delivered to end users in a single package and rendered using the WebKit HTML engine.

The only requirement is that the users of AIR-applications have the AIR runtime engine installed (very much like Adobe Flash users need to have the Flash-plugin installed on their system). In fact, Adobe AIR is becoming more and more popular with over 100 million installations of the engine across the globe and <a href="https://www.adobe.com/cfusion/marketplace/index.cfm?event=marketplace.categories&amp;marketplaceId=1&amp;categoryid=">over 470 AIR-applications</a> featured on Adobe AIR Market Place.</p>

### Adobe AIR SDK

To get you started, you will need the runtime environment for running AIR applications on your OS (<a href="https://labs.adobe.com/downloads/air.html">download the latest version of Adobe AIR</a> – you will be asked for the OS you are using). You will also need the <em>Adobe AIR Software Development Kit (SDK)</em> to develop, build and deploy Adobe AIR applications.

This development kit (will provide you with the framework for AIR APIs, a template for the Adobe AIR application install badge, the command-line Adobe AIR Debug Launcher and the command-line Adobe AIR Developer tool. The kits are available for Mac OS X (22.1 Mb), Windows (15.8 Mb) and Linux (18.5 Mb).</p>

## Official Adobe AIR Resources

For quick reference here is a brief overview of the essential official Adobe AIR resources that may come in handy for developers of AIR-applications.

AIR 101
To be launched in AIR, an HTML or SWF application requires an application XML file (a.k.a. an application descriptor file). You can almost consider this application XML file the actual AIR application file: it is initially opened and read by AIR, it specifies application properties such as application window name and size, and it identifies which file (HTML or SWF) is to be loaded into the AIR container.

Using SQL with Adobe AIR
If you didn’t know already, AIR comes with a genuine lightweight database: an implementation of SQLite. You can create tables and views, insert and delete data and run queries. The API that does this is the flash.data package. If you are interested in using the SQL capabilities of AIR, then read on.

Flash Applications for Use in the Browser and AIR
This tutorial shows you how applications can be developed for both the Web and AIR runtime using a programming pattern known as the “factory pattern.”

Custom Move and Resize Window Controls in AIR
This tutorial covers how to use ActionScript to both move and resize an AIR application’s window using Flash controls.

Setting Up an AIR Application with File Associations
You can associate any file type with your AIR applications. This means associated files open in your AIR application. This greatly streamlines your ability to work with external files. This tutorial shows you how to do that.

Using AIR to Get and Set Clipboard Text
In addition to offering the advantages of running as a desktop application, AIR applications are also able to both get and set content from the operating system’s clipboard. This tutorial shows you how to do both with simple text data.
