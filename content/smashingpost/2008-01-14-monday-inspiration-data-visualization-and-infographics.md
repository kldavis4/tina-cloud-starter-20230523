The main goal of <strong>data visualization</strong> is its ability to <em>visualize</em> data, communicating information clearly and effectivelty. It doesn't mean that data visualization needs to look boring to be functional or extremely sophisticated to look beautiful. To convey ideas effectively, both aesthetic form and functionality need to go hand in hand, providing insights into a rather sparse and complex data set by communicating its key-aspects in a more intuitive way. Yet designers often tend to discard the balance between design and function, creating gorgeous data visualizations which fail to serve its main purpose — communicate information. 

In both print and web design <em>infographics</em> — visual representations of information, data or knowledge — are often used to support information, strengthen it and present it within a provoking and sensitive context, depending on designer's creativity.

This article presents some <strong>spectacular data visualizations and infographics</strong> which manage to combine a strong visual appeal with the effective presentation of information.

<a href="https://christopherbaker.net/projects/mymap/">MyMap</a>
A data visualization application capable of <strong>rendering the relationships between the user and individuals</strong> in the address book by examining the TO:, FROM:, and CC: fields of every email in the 60,000-large email archive.the intensity of the relationship is determined by the color intensity of the line. "My Map" allows to explore different relational groupings and periods of time, revealing the temporal ebbs and flows in various relationships. My Map thus becomes a veritable self-portrait, a visual reflection of personal associations and relationships.

Using rented botnets, you can launch hundreds of thousands — even millions — of <strong>infobombs</strong> at a target, all while maintaining total deniability. In this hypothetical scenario, a single attack launched by China against the US lasts only a few hours, but a full-scale assault lasting days or weeks could bring an entire modern information economy to its knees. This infographic is supposed to illustrate it.
