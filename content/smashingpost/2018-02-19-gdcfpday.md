A CFP, or Call For Proposals (sometimes also known as a Call For Papers), is a request for speakers to send their proposed talk ideas to a conference. The conference will review the proposals and decide who to ask to speak. Popular conferences can receive hundreds of proposals for a handful of speaking slots, therefore creating a great proposal is an important skill to learn as a speaker. To help encourage people to write and submit to CFPs, [Global Diversity CFP Day](https://www.globaldiversitycfpday.com/) aims to help underrepresented people submit proposals to speak at conferences. The events are based on successful workshops held by ScotlandCSS and ScotlandJS in advance of their 2016 conference; it is amazing to see how far the idea has spread.

I was fortunate enough to be asked to mentor at [the workshop in Bristol, UK](https://www.globaldiversitycfpday.com/events/4). Like the other events worldwide, a small group of mentors worked with a group of people who were keen to speak at conferences. Some of the attendees hadn’t presented at all; others had some experience of presenting to colleagues or at meetups but were wanting to take the next step and submit to larger conferences.

As a mentor, I felt that the day was nicely structured; there were videos which were shown at all of the events and activities based around coming up with ideas, writing the abstract, and also writing the all-important biography. Some events had brought in a photographer to take headshots, which was a great idea. Most events had mentors who were experienced speakers, or conference organizers, who could give practical advice based on their own experiences.

<blockquote>“This was such a great initiative to be involved with.  As a woman in tech, when I began speaking I really struggled to know if it was OK for someone like me to be on the stage.  To meet the voices of the future and be able to give them a little bit of reassurance taking their first steps was amazing!”<br /><br/>&mdash; Lorna Mitchell, organizer of the Leeds event</blockquote>

## Thinking About Inclusivity

<blockquote>“Good sessions at #gdcfpday on caring for your audience: inclusive language and content warnings. Great to be thinking about diversity in the audience as well as the speakers”<br /><br />&mdash; <a href="https://twitter.com/FCTweedie/status/959605607849324544">Fiona Tweedie</a></blockquote>

The **diversity** part of Global Diversity CFP Day was not just about the diversity of the workshop participants; the theme was carried through into suggestions for proposal and talk content. One of the activities involved looking at inclusive and exclusive terminology we might use in our talks. I confessed to having had some success at removing my use of “guys” when talking about mixed groups, but that I still found myself using ableist language &mdash; such as “crazy.” In our group, we talked about how this is an ongoing process, changing the language you have used for 40 years is hard! However, I keep trying to do so and being aware of any potentially exclusive behavior, and terminology is the first step. We also tried to come up with words or phrases that can be used as a replacement for the exclusive words.

<figure><a href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/1a178515-9b75-4a0d-b607-427eb3fc6ce1/gdcfpday-stickies.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/1a178515-9b75-4a0d-b607-427eb3fc6ce1/gdcfpday-stickies.jpg" width="1200" height="900" alt="Sticky notes on a table" /></a><figcaption>Notes from the inclusive language session at Bristol</figcaption></figure>

We also talked about non-obvious exclusive behavior. One example would be making the assumption that everyone in the room was a Star Wars geek and basing a talk around Star Wars. This would mean that all of the analogies were obscure to someone who hadn’t seen the film and could make them feel not part of the community because everyone else is laughing and enjoying the talk.

## Reports From Around The Globe

With 53 workshops happening worldwide, those in Australia had come to an end before I headed out to our event in Bristol, and people were still taking part on the West Coast of the USA as I was thinking about heading to bed. There were plenty of tweets and write-ups from those events. Jo Franchetti was a mentor in London, and [wrote about her experiences](https://medium.com/the-codelog/global-diversity-cfp-day-london-7900d42a1850):

<blockquote>“As a mentor, I was endlessly impressed by the topics that the attendees presented and their personal journeys to this point in their tech careers. They each had a unique and fascinating view into their own area of expertise and suggested talk ideas that had me eager to hear more. These weren’t people who needed help writing a CFP; they just needed the encouragement and confidence boost to get their CFPs out of their heads and into application forms.”<br /><br />&mdash; Jo Franchetti, London event</blockquote>

Katie K was involved with the event in Seattle, USA, and [wrote a blog post](https://www.pewpewlaser.com/blogs/681) answering some of the questions that were asked at her event. I liked this suggestion to speak at meetups.

<blockquote>“… meetup organizers need to have a few talks each and every month of the year, so they are very likely to accept your talk. You can get very helpful feedback from attendees (What did they take away from the talk? What was confusing?) after giving a meetup talk.”<br /><br />&mdash; Katie K, Seattle event</blockquote>

Ida Aalen was a mentor in Berlin and has also [published a blog post](https://medium.com/confrere/be-a-conference-speaker-takeaways-from-the-global-diversity-cfp-day-in-berlin-f1f51401f5d2) with some tips, including advice from Florian Gilcher, who shared the criteria used at their conference when assessing proposals. I loved this advice on what to do if you forget what you were going to say next. It is completely true that you are likely to be the only person who notices. Take a pause, perhaps grab a drink of water and move on.

<blockquote>“If you forget what you were going to say, just take a pause, and move on to the next part that you do remember. Most people won’t notice that the transition was a little weird, and if they do notice, they will probably think that it was because they themselves weren’t paying attention!”<br /><br />&mdash; Ida Aalen, Berlin event</blockquote>

Several members of the IBM Developer Advocates team were at events, and have published <a href="https://medium.com/ibm-watson-data-lab/reflections-on-global-diversity-cfp-day-d26355c971">a blog post about their experiences</a>.

<blockquote>“One of my favorite takeaways from the event was the reassurance that beginners — who make up a decent percentage of conference attendees — love talks from people not much more experienced than they are. A speaker who’s closer in experience level to their audience is often in a better position to explain concepts in a comprehensible way than someone more experienced might be.”<br /><br />&mdash; Teri Chadbourne, Boston event</blockquote>

There were plenty of tweets throughout the day from attendees on the [\#gdcfpday hashtag](https://twitter.com/hashtag/gdcfpday?src=hash). Many people used the hashtag to post their own tips and tricks, or link to ongoing CFPs too.

<blockquote>“Came up with a great title and abstract for a conference talk thanks to #gdcfpday Such an inspiring event, learned heaps and met super interesting people.”<br /><br />&mdash; <a href="https://twitter.com/Karen_Geerts/status/959619133603065856">Karen Geerts</a></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Fantastic way to kick off the weekend with #gdcfpday Melbourne &mdash; interesting and passionate bunch of people, there's gonna be some great new talks coming soon”<br /><br />&mdash; <a href="https://twitter.com/MichelePlayfair/status/959642369673986048">Michele Playfair</a></blockquote>

The day has already proved successful for at least one speaker, <a href="https://twitter.com/jiggy_pete/status/963887018286682112">with Jennifer Shehane accepted to speak at We RISE Tech Conference in Atlanta</a>. In addition, some locations are planning more regular meetups to help new speakers, such as the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/SF-Tech-Talk-Diversity-Meetup/">SF Tech Talk Diversity Meetup</a>.

### Where To Find Conferences And Meetups To Submit To

If there are conferences you really would like to speak at, follow them on Twitter or see if they have a newsletter signup. They will be sure to advertise their CfP. Some good places to look for upcoming calls are:

- [Mozilla Tech Speakers CfP Calendar](https://tchspk.rs/cfp)
- [PaperCall](https://www.papercall.io/events)
- [Callback Women on Twitter](https://twitter.com/CallbackWomen)
- [DevOps Conferences](https://devopsconferences.org/)

Remember that local meetups often won’t advertise they are looking for speakers, but pretty much every tech meetup is _always_ looking for speakers. You’ll be doing them a favor if you propose a talk. Go along to your local events, and have a chat with the organizer afterwards or send them an email about your talk idea.

### Writing Presentations

Every presenter has their own method. If you are new to writing talks then try different approaches, you will find what works for you.

- "[How To Write A Talk](https://be.noti.st/2017/how-to-write-a-talk)," Rachel Andrew  
I asked people on Twitter how they wrote their talks &mdash; you can see that people have completely different approaches. Experiment, and find what works best for you.

### Designing Slides

I am not a designer; I also tend to write talks that are heavy on code examples. I am t make my slides clear and readable, and I’ve learned to worry less about making them beautiful as time has gone on. My top tip is to come up with a slide theme, with a few different slide options, and then use it. It’s possible to burn up a huge amount of time better spent rehearsing your material, messing about with slides!

- "[A white-label slide deck](https://alicebartlett.co.uk/blog/how-to-do-ok-at-slides)," Alice Bartlett  
If, like me, you struggle with making slides, then this may help. Alice Bartlett shares a sample slide deck and explains what each slide is for.

### Public Speaking Advice

There is plenty of advice out there, read it, find the things that work for you and don’t be afraid to discard the things that don’t.

### Payment And Expenses

When you first start out, you may find yourself speaking at local meetups, or for community events that have little budget. However, if a conference is expecting you to travel, or you need to stay in a hotel there should be a budget to cover those costs. Always ask! It is sadly common for events to have a budget for these things but to only mention it when speakers ask, this puts new speakers at a disadvantage as they may not realize they should be having their costs covered.

Many events to pay or offer some kind of honorarium to speakers, my personal rule is that if the event is making money, they should be paying speakers. I try and do community events where possible, often by offering to go along and speak at a local meetup when I’m in a location for another event.

- "[How To Ask To Get Paid To Speak](https://seb.ly/2014/05/how-to-ask-to-get-paid-to-speak/)," Web Lee-Delisle  
Some suggestions on broaching the question, and why you should.

- "[Questions For Event Organizers](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/my-questions-for-event-organizers/)," Ethan Marcotte  
 This not only covers how to handle speaking fees but is also a good write-up of the sort of things you should be asking the organizer.
- "[What I Learned From Posting A Survey Of Conference Speakers](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2016/05/27/what-i-learned-from-posting-a-survey-of-conference-speakers/)," Rachel Andrew  
In 2016, I spoke at an event about speaking and created a survey to ask conference speakers their thoughts. The results were very interesting.

### Books

I have read and would recommend all of these books on speaking.

- "[Demystifying Public Speaking](https://abookapart.com/products/demystifying-public-speaking)," Lara Hogan  
This book is a must-read for tech speakers. 
- "[Presentation Now: Prepare A Perfect Presentation In Less Than 3 Hours](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Presentation-Now-Prepare-first-presentation-ebook/dp/B019CT3196/)," Andrew Lightheart

- "[Confessions of a Public Speaker](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Confessions-Public-Speaker-Scott-Berkun/dp/1449301959)," Scott Berkun.  
I read this book when I was taking my first step into speaking, and at one of the very first conferences I spoke at &mdash; Scott was speaking, too! Lots of practical, and funny, advice.
- "[Illuminate: Ignite Change Through Speeches, Stories, Ceremonies, And Symbols](https://www.amazon.com/Illuminate-Through-Speeches-Stories-Ceremonies/dp/1101980168)," Nancy Duarte and Patti Sanchez

## Over To You!

If speaking at a conference or event is something you would love to do, make a start today. It's a great time of year for conference proposals with events looking to fill their speaker lineups for the rest of 2018. I hope that Global Diversity CFP Day runs again next year. It would be especially wonderful to see some of the attendees come back as mentors &mdash; to share what happened when their proposals were accepted, and they presented for the first time.
