### Behind the Design

As always, here are some insights from the designer:
<blockquote>"Like any design studio, here at <em>offset media</em>, we prefer to create our own festive greeting cards to give to clients. This year I had a very clear vision of the overall look I wanted, a single white festive character on a solid red background.

Knowing the look, but unsure of what character to use, I ended up creating a bunch of icons to choose from. Once we were happy with the card design (choosing the snowman), we had all these unused icons lying about, and being someone who does not likes things going to waste, I decided to share them with others who could possible make use of them!"

Thank you, George. We appreciate your work and your good intentions!
