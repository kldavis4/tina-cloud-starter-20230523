How many creative solutions for <strong>calendar design</strong> are out there? If you take a look around you'll find out that most calendars are designed in a "standard" linear fashion. Calendar cards usually have the same structure: the month is designed in bold while the days are placed below within a rigid grid structure. Well, it doesn't have to be like this. In fact, there are a number of creative approaches one can consider when designing calendars. 

Indeed, designers sometimes risk unique design solutions. However, unusual design is not necessarily a good design. It is important that your calendar design reveals function and remains usable. Function is more important than the design. In fact, some designs listed below may be not that user-friendly, but they may serve as a nice starting point and give you some fresh ideas for your future designs.

This post showcases <strong>creative examples of calendar design</strong>. We have tried to include creative, visually appealing and interesting design solutions. Hopefully, everybody will find something interesting and unusual for herself or himself.

## Beautiful and Creative Calendars

### [Magnetic Calendar](https://www.behance.net/Gallery/Dorogaya-Magnetic-Calendar/97189)

Eternal, easy customized magnetic calendar. With, even, 32nd day of month just in case. Month's names abbreviated to 3 letters. Chips can be placed one over another. Special appeal of this calendar is special chips, like "Deadline", "Arrival", "Departure", five "Drink Day" and one "Don't Drink Day". Designed by Serhiy and Igor Chebotaryov.

### [A-Calendar](https://www.behance.net/Gallery/A-calendar/85241)

Fun little project: this calendar displays the daily hours of sunshine 30 years ago, projected onto the year 2008. Well, that was <em>a lot</em> of work. Designed by Sven Ellingen.

### Too cool for words

It’s actually extremely simple: you just need to commit to memory that .|..|...|~|,,,|,,|, &gt; January to December. So if you want to find out what day name was November 20, you go to 20, move up to the November row, find ... and you know immediately that it was a Tuesday. And it has some BIG type as well.

### [Colour calendar](https://www.aisleone.net/2007/design/colour-calendar-2008/)

Colour Calendar 2008 – and every day once again gets its own special color from Switzerland’s design genius, Moritz Zwimpfer. This appealing, spiral-bound desk calendar is a bit like a Pantone book with room for notes; each day’s color brings its own scent, taste and sound, the implications of memory, the possibilities of the future. A beautiful little object, impeccably printed, for the desk or attaché case of a design aficionado, promising enjoyment long after 2008 is history. The appendix includes a calendar overview for 2008-2009, Pantone codes for the 365 colors, and blank pages for memos. Designed by Moritz Zwimpfer.

### [Orange diagonal with outer numbers](https://www.flickr.com/photos/eliazar/374137590/in/pool-calendarcards)

For one thing, orange and gray are a great combination, but more importantly it has an other-worldly weirdness that I very much appreciate it. I guess the strangeness comes from being a novel (I think) way to extend everyday two-dimensional tables with one extra dimension. It's not a perfect extension--confusing and difficult to follow--but it's intriguing.

### Post-It Calendar

Calendar made from post-it paper, the layout and design still needs some work (as always, any of your suggestions and thoughts are more than welcome), but here is the rough concept. The principle how it works: for each day you have a post-it note, each one has a date and a to-do list, before you leave your house, you peel todays note from the wall/frige/whatever and put it in you wallet. Designed by Andrei Slobtsov.

### Dupont - Corian Calendar

<em>Corian 40 years/40 designers</em> was created to recognize the input designers have made and continue to make to Corian. DuPont asked 40 international designers to create a genuinely functional object - a table or desktop accessory - that reflects the ingenuity of the designers as well as the design possibilities of Corian.

### [Calendar 2008](https://www.behance.net/Gallery/2008-Calendar/54705)

"For one thing, orange and gray are a great combination, but more importantly it has an other-worldly weirdness that I very much appreciate it. I guess the strangeness comes from being a novel (I think) way to extend everyday two-dimensional tables with one extra dimension. It's not a perfect extension--confusing and difficult to follow — but it's intriguing." Who knows, maybe you could develop the idea further?

## Chalkboard Wall Calendar

A home office is the ideal spot for a family planner. Six weeks worth of squares in a variety of shades can accommodate several schedules. The entire wall is also coated with chalkboard paint for more memos. Start with a base coat of store-bought black chalkboard paint, then mix in varying amounts of white chalkboard paint for lighter squares.
