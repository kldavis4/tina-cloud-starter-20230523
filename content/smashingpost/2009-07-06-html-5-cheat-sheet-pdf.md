XHTML 2 is dead, long live HTML5! According to W3C News Archive, <a href="https://www.zeldman.com/2009/07/02/xhtml-wtf/">XHTML 2 working group is expected to stop work</a> end of 2009 and W3C is planning to increase resources on HTML5 instead. And even although HTML 5 won’t be completely supported until 2022, it doesn't mean that it won't be widely adopted within the foreseeable future. 

So in the spirit of the upcoming change we decided to release a handy <strong>printable HTML5 Cheat Sheet</strong> that lists all currently supported tags, their descriptions, their attributes and their support in HTML4.</p>

## <span class="rh">Further Reading</span> on SmashingMag:

*   [Road Map To Coding With HTML5: Tutorials and Guidelines](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/coding-with-html5-tutorials-guidelines/)

Please notice that the specification is an ongoing work, and is expected to remain so for many years, although parts of HTML5 are going to be finished and implemented in browsers before the whole specification reaches final Recommendation status. We'll do our best to update the cheat sheet when new changes will become known. The cheat sheet was created by our friends from <a href="https://www.veign.com">Veign</a> and released exclusively for the readers of Smashing Magazine.
