Over the last few weeks, our readers have complained that we have been releasing "<strong>way too many freebies</strong>". Apparently, we have been posting "too many filler articles" containing freebies that can be found elsewhere on the Web. We would like to make it clear that we do try to release useful things, and we do try to keep the high quality of these freebies and it has never been our intention to fill our publishing schedule with freebie posts.

### Motivation behind the design

Here are some insights from the designer himself:

"I recently discovered the fireworks mode on my Sony Cybershot and have since been <strong>experimenting with a bunch of different light sources</strong>. The results have been pretty interesting, so I thought I would make some of them into a brush set. For this set I used candles, a desk lamp, my iPhone, my car radio, my car cigarette lighter, a clock radio, street lights and some sparklers (the most fun!).

I then took the image, changed it to a grayscale document, inverted the colours, then adjusted the levels until I was happy with the contrast. They're all quite large brushes and could be useful for a lot of different effects so I hope you enjoy! Feel free to use them for anything you like - both commercial and personal. Please send me a link if you end up using any of my brushes in your designs â€“ I would love to see them!"

Thank you, Ben. We appreciate your efforts and your intentions. By the way, together with a couple of <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/04/03/adobe-photoshop-tutorials-rainbows-glows-and-light-effects/">professional Photoshop tutorials for glows and light effects</a> you can certainly use this set to add some beautiful lightning effects in your designs.</p>
