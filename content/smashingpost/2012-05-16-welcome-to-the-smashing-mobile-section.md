### What type of content can you expect?

By and large, Derek will be presenting specific, actionable articles on techniques you can use in your work today. From responsive website design to mobile Web apps to native apps to testing techniques..We'll highlight techniques and tools and case studies that you can all learn from, comment on and help drive the conversation to shape the mobile space.

Of course, if you have an idea for an article please don't hesitate to get in touch with Derek directly — he truly values the amazing community of Smashing Magazine readers (heck, I've been one for years!) and want _you_ involved.</p>

### Introducing Derek Allard

> [![Derek Allard](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0b5b27e1-149b-4414-a82f-b8feff134041/derek-allard-mobile-editor.png)](https://twitter.com/derekallard)"I've been working on the Web since the late 1990s and still remember the days of the original browser wars. Over the years, I've worked for large companies, small design shops and as a freelance design/developer. I have been on the front lines of working with clients to determine the best approach to meet their mobile needs and I pride myself on continuing to learn every day.

Mobile is the brave, new frontier in digital design and it is an exciting time to be involved with all things mobile! When Vitaly first asked me to serve as the editor of this new mobile section—I will confess—I was a bit apprehensive. Sure, I've worked on mobile projects, but there is _so much more_ that is unknown in this space. Best practices are still emerging. New technologies are still emerging. Every day new articles are written with new techniques, new strategies and new thinking. And that's when it occurred to me... all of us are in that same boat! My hope in serving as the mobile editor is that I can help steer the conversation to practical, worthwhile thinking that we can all benefit from.

Serving as the editor of this mobile section is an honor. Over the past few months I have connected with many of the best minds in mobile and worked with them to develop articles that I trust you will find insightful and educational as we make this journey into the brave, new mobile frontier... together.

Currently, I work at [Gravity Switch](https://www.gravityswitch.com "Gravity Switch"), an innovative Web design shop located in Northampton, MA. I specialize in working with ExpressionEngine and have a bent towards website optimization through the use of analytical tools. I also present workshops regularly on a wide range of topics related to design and development and I am frequently found conversing on Twitter [@derekallard](https://www.twitter.com/derekallard "Derek Allard on Twitter").

When not working I am an avid cyclist (rode over 5,000 miles last year!), a dabbler at the piano and the wrangler of a 10 pound chihuahua/yorkie terrier... that my wife picked out."</blockquote>
