  What makes a great conference? It fuels your ideas and polishes up your
  skills. It fosters your **professional growth** and takes your work to the
  next level. Luckily, a lot of conferences provide videos of their talks after
  the event has ended, some do even stream live to pass on their knowledge even
  if you couldn’t attend.

  The videos collected in this round-up revive the spirit of the conferences
  they were recorded at and cater for a lot of fresh insights and light-bulb
  moments to make the learning never stop. As a very special goodie, we’re very
  pleased to also feature the **live stream of this year’s Build 2016
  Conference**, taking place at the Moscone Center in San Francisco, CA, right
  here on Smashing.
