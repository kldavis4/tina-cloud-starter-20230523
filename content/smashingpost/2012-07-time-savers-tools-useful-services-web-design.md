We have plenty of useful resources, tools and services created, developed and released every single day: apart from goodies such as free fonts or icons, there are also many educational resources and little time-savers that can significantly improve designer's workflow. We permanently look out for the new projects and support them by presenting them on <a href="https://twitter.com/smashingmag">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/smashmag">Facebook</a>, in our <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-smashing-newsletter/">e-mail newsletter</a> and, evidently, in Smashing Magazine's posts.</p>

<p>Being a web designer is not easy. Not only do we need to have a good understanding about visual design, typography, information architecture, psychology and a plethora of other disciplines; in our work, we need to take care of so many details, so that our job becomes more and more time-consuming, requiring dozens of tools, attention span and an effective workflow for beautiful, timely and functional results.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/28/50-powerful-time-savers-for-web-designers/"><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/51fc8b28-1caa-4aca-a170-8c00f2c4d785/launch.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="500" height="300" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Typography</strong> is elegant when it is attractive and communicates the designer&#8217;s ideas. When chosen wisely and used carefully, it can be very effective in supporting the overall design. Designers are always exploring different techniques with type: some use images or sIFR to produce very beautiful typography, while others prefer CSS alone to get the typography just right.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/01/27/css-typographic-tools-and-techniques/"><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c20187c0-b78d-411c-b300-236b90c8eee3/tc.jpg" alt="TypeChart" width="500" height="311" /></a></p>

We will also look at some hands-on typography tools that help designers and developers learn how to style their Web content, test it interactively and see the changes instantly. These tools are great for experimenting with different font types for your website.</p>

<p>Wireframing is one of the most valuable parts of any web design project. It can save a designer tons of time by hashing out the details of a site’s architecture, functionality, and content prior to actually starting a visual design. But if done inefficiently, it can end up costing more time and can even create bigger headaches for both the client and the designer. Here you find more than 35 resources for creating better wireframes, including tutorials on different methods and a variety of tools available.</p>

<p>There are many useful Web development tools that integrate  in your browser. These in-browser tools are commonly known as <em>add-ons</em> or <em>extensions</em>. Though add-ons and extensions aren't <em>just</em> for Web development, many  of them out there are designed specifically for Web developers. In-browser tools vary greatly in the jobs they perform; for example, some of them help you  diagnose issues with CSS, HTML and JavaScript, while others evaluate the  accessibility of your website.</p>

<p>In this article, we explore some of <strong>the most popular and useful in-browser Web development tools</strong>.  You'll find tools for popular Web browsers like Firefox and Internet Explorer. Whether you need to debug and inspect your HTML, inspect  HTTP headers, access FTP source files, evaluate accessibility or just figure out what  color a Web page element is, you may find a variety of tools discussed here useful.</p>

<p><strong>Podcasting</strong> is an engaging medium that is available in both audio and video formats. Podcasts often refer to audiocasts, but now with iPods and other media players being able to play video, videocasts are just as popular. A handful of web design podcasters deliver both audio and video formats. Some do so through the same subscription, others separate the two.</p>

<p>Audio podcasts are a great way to <em>stay informed</em> about web design news, <em>learn about emerging technologies</em>, listen to discussions, and continuously learn about the ever-changing landscape of web design &mdash; on your way to work or before you go to bed. Videocasts are great at showing step by step tutorials, or delivering visually rich presentations. Many of the long running successful podcasts have communities built around the show. Forums and detailed show notes are usual for a podcast that regularly serves its community. The time span of how long a podcast exists often indicates its level of quality and professionalism.</p>

<p>We've amassed a collection of podcasts that are either directly about web design, or would be helpful to a web designer. If you're interested in more podcasts try searching through <a href="https://odeo.com/">Odeo</a> or <a href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a>. There are quite a few web development podcasts, and a few niche topic web design podcasts, not covered in this roundup.

<p>If you've used them once you'll never be able to work without them. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet">Bookmarklets</a> (or <em>Favelets</em>) are tiny Javascript-Snippets, which are stored within a bookmark and add particular functionalities to the browser you're using. It doesn't matter whether you browse, bookmark, look up, search, design or program - depending on your interests, bookmarklets can significantly enhance your efficiency and productivity. However, if you take a look around, you'll find hundreds of sites, which offer favelets of any possible kinds. Indeed, you'll find thousands of bookmarklets, many of which you aren't really interested in. What you eventually <strong>are</strong> interested in, is a hand-picked choice of the most useful snippets you can directly copy and use from one single page.</p>

<p>Since our <a href="https://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/04/18/powerful-new-css-techniques-and-tools/">last round-up of useful CSS techniques</a><sup class="print_only"> 1</sup>, we’ve seen a lot of truly remarkable CSS geekery out there. With CSS3, some of the older techniques now have become obsolete, others have established themselves as standards, and many techniques are still in the “crazy experimentation” stage.</p>

<p>Since the release of the previous post, we’ve been collecting, sorting, filtering and preparing a compact <strong>overview of powerful new CSS techniques</strong>. Today we finally present some of these techniques. Use them right away or save them for future reference.</p>

<p>Usability and user experience testing is vital to creating a successful website, and only more so if it’s an e-commerce website, a complex app or another website for which there’s a definite ROI. And running your own user tests to find out how users are interacting with your website and where problems might arise is completely possible.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/10/20/comprehensive-review-usability-user-experience-testing-tools/"></a></p>

<p>But using one of the many existing tools and services for user testing is a lot easier than creating your own. Free, freemium and premium tools are out there, with options for most budgets. The important thing is to find a tool or service that works for your website and then use it to <strong>gather real-world data on what works and what doesn’t</strong>, rather than relying purely on instinct or abstract theories.</p>

<p>Perhaps we should warn you upfront for the long compilation, but what can we say — there are so many excellent tools out there which deserve attention of the community, yet unfortunately remain obscure way too often. We love all the designers and developers out there for releasing and producing useful, valuable resources for all of us to use! We, for one, surely sincerely appreciate it in the name of the Web design community. Whether you like it or not, here are some of the <strong>most useful coding and workflow tools released recently</strong>.</p>
