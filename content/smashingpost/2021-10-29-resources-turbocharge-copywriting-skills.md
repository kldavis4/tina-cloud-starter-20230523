I believe that copywriting is the most valuable skill you’ll ever learn. Great copy engages your readers, builds connections, turns readers into consumers and consumers into brand evangelists. Of course, this all means a fatter bottom line, which makes you the most popular person in the room!

If you’re ready to acquire near-mystical powers of persuasion, check out these useful resources and tools that are bound to help strengthen your copywriting skills.

## Brush Up On Your Language Skills

I’d like to introduce this section with a small proviso. Great grammar does not equal great copywriting. Copywriting is a unique animal, different from academic, journalistic or literary writing. Copywriting is about human psychology, consumer behaviour and applying tried and tested methodologies. It’s not about beautiful words, and I know many great writers who make poor copywriters and vice versa.

That said, **language mistakes matter** if they get in the way of comprehension. So it’s worth brushing up on those language skills to avoid errors that will derail your message.

## Master Plain English

In a hectic world, getting straight to the point and communicating your message quickly and clearly is a non-negotiable. But the most common challenge budding copywriters tell me about is writing concisely. This is partly because of some very unhelpful lessons we learnt at school.

So I’m going to ask you to forget all those long words and stop writing winding sentences. It may be big, but it’s not clever. Find out why below…

- [The Complete Plain Words | Plain Words](https://plain-words.com/)  
Sir Ernest Gowers was an eminent civil servant who railed against the convoluted language so often used in the service. Sixty years after he wrote Plain Words, it’s still a superb and charmingly written guide to clear communication.

## Understand Style Guides And Brand Voice

When your brand talks, what does it sound like? Your brand voice is a vital part of your overall brand identity, building connections, trust and recognition with your readers. Brand voice covers tone, language and style points (whether to capitalise, how to format dates, Oxford comma or no Oxford comma, and so on).
