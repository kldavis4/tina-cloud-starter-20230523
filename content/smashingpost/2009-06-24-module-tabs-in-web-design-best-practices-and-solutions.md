A **module tab** is a User Interface (UI) design pattern where content is separated into different panes, and each pane is viewable one at a time. The user requests content to be displayed by clicking (or in some instances hovering over) the content's corresponding tab control.

Module tabs are seeing an increase of use as websites and web applications push for optimizing web page screen areas without sacrificing the amount of information presented at once. For example, in weblogs, Â they are used in secondary content sections (such as the sidebar) to present relevant and interesting information such as a listing of blog posts which users can interact with to get to web pages quicker. This inevitably allows for an unobtrusive and compact manner of presenting content.

This article discusses the use of the module tabs design pattern for use in websites and web-based applications. We share with you some **best practices** to consider when using module tabs, a listing of **real-world examples** of websites that take advantage of module tabs, as well as **tutorials** and free **downloadable scripts** for building and deploying module tabs in your sites.</p>

## Anatomy of a Module Tab Area

It's worth a few moments to identify the key parts of a module tabs for the purpose of standardization of the terminologies used in the discussion.

{{% feature-panel %}}

![An illustration of the anatomy of module tabs - see the following description to learn about the anatomy.](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ddb78f23-ce71-4700-b255-5e71ab55ab9d/anatomy.gif)

*   The **tab control area** is the location of the tab controls.
*   **Tab controls** are the interface component for navigating through the module tabs **panes**.
*   The **tab control text** is the text that describes the tab control. It should be short (one to two words) and should effectively depict the corresponding **pane information**.
*   The **active tab control** refers to the tab control that is presently selected. Only one tab control should be active. The first tab control is the **default active tab control** when the web page first loads.
*   **Inactive tab controls** are the tab controls whose panes are not currently showing.
*   A **pane** is where information is displayed; it should have a corresponding **tab control** so that panes that are not displayed are accessible by clicking its tab control.
*   **Pane content** is the content being presented inside of a pane.
*   The **active pane** is the pane that is currently being shown; it is paired with the active tab control. The pane that is displayed immediately when the web page first loads is the **default active pane**.
*   **Inactive panes** (not shown in the illustration) are the panes that are currently not being shown. An inactive pane becomes the active pane when its tab control is clicked.</p>

## When to Use Module Tabs

The primary goal of the module tabs UI pattern is to permit users to view a group of related data one at a time, which in turn allows designers to modularize this group of information in a compacted manner, saving valuable screen real estate. In this section, we'll discuss the instances when module tabs are desirable.</p>

### Information that is related

Information in the panes of module tabs must have some connection to each other so that users can make a logical correlation towards the content of the component.

For example, having a module tab for blog posts is a great use of module tabs; pane information can be organized into categories such as recent posts, popular posts, and most commented posts.

In the following image, you can see the module tab design pattern in action on [Webdesigner Depot](https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/)'s sidebar using panes for all posts, the site's most popular posts, and latest posts.

[![Webdesigner depot module tabs.](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ee588a40-9df1-4f0e-9237-00309aa02603/webdesignerdepot.gif)](https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/)

### Information that Doesn't Need to be Compared or Accessed Simultaneously

Using module tabs means that information in different panes will be shown to users one at a time. Only when the appropriate tab control is activated will the view switch to another pane. When information on panes must be compared to each other, or when pane information is better presented simultaneously, it's best **not to use** the module tabs pattern because it can produce an **annoying experience** when website users have to click back and forth to compare and contrast information.

As a counter-example, the module tabs implementation in [BGPatterns](https://www.bgpatterns.com/) is a situation where you should avoid using module tabs. When designing a background pattern, users must click back and forth through the tabs to tweak their designs; this adds an unnecessary hindrance for modifying the background pattern being designed. For convenience and usability, this type of content should be presented concurrently.

[![BGPatterns misuse of module tabs.](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/024fc0f5-a3cc-4eff-89e6-2399d5a4fe25/bgpatterns.gif)](https://www.bgpatterns.com/)

### Information that can Have Short Categorical Names

Module tabs have space limitations which restricts the length of tab control text. Because of this, the tab control text must be succinct, typically using **only one to three key words**. This not only preserves the design pattern's primary intent, which is to allow the presentation of data in a condensed area, but also allows for easier processing of information so that users can anticipate what content will be presented in the panes.</p>

### Module Tabs is for Terse Content

Module tabs are meant to contain modular and easily digested information, and as such, module tabs are **only appropriate for data that is succinct and to the point** such as lists, data conveyed as graphics ([data visualization](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/08/02/data-visualization-modern-approaches/)), or one to two short paragraphs of text.</p>

### Pane Content Should be Related

The module tabs design pattern implies that there is a relationship between information displayed on each pane, therefore you should have content that can be logically grouped together.

For example, using module tabs for "most popular posts", "recent posts", and "most commented posts" have a rational category.

As a counter-example, consider [Best Web Gallery](https://bestwebgallery.com/page/3/)'s implementation of module tabs on the site's sidebar content. The module tabs show "Extras" (which contain noteworthy links according to the site owner) and "Recent Comments": two groups of information that have no logical connection with each other. This can lead to user confusion as they try to make sense of why these two groups of information are presented together. The content in the module tabs is best conveyed **separately**.

[![Best Web Gallery not using related content for module tabs.](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7b33dd46-c2a9-441d-bdb4-8b163ea5d307/best-web-gallery.gif)](https://bestwebgallery.com/page/3/)

## Module Tabs Usability and Best Practices

In this section, we shall discuss some important usability guidelines to make module tabs an effective and user-friendly component of a web design.</p>

### Highlight the Active Tab Control Effectively

The user must know which pane is currently active, and to do so, you must make the **active tab easily distinguishable** when compared to inactive tab controls. Choosing background-colors that highly-contrast with each other for inactive tabs and the active tab is highly recommended to trigger visual cues for which pane is currently active.</p>

### Show Tab Controls in a Single Row

Module tabs typically use horizontally-oriented tab controls (though if you wish, you can adapt this pattern for singular vertical/columnar orientation) because having multiple rows makes the interaction confusing.

When you have more than one row of tab controls, it **implies a hierarchical relationship** where lower-positioned tab controls are children of (or the subcategory of) higher-positioned tab controls.

The need for more than one row of tab controls is indicative of having **too many panes** and/or that the **tab control text is too long** and should be revised for terseness.

![Single row counter example - having two rows implies that tab controls have a hierarcial relationship.](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f7093dd5-62d4-4174-a6db-7f3cf1b13ced/singlerow-counter-example.gif)

### Switching in Between Panes Should be Fast

A purpose for using module tabs is to permit quick and interactive presentation of content. For this, you should try to have the inactive pane contents written inline in the HTML document, and then use CSS and JavaScript to style and hide the pane visually, which is quicker than requiring a page reload or requesting remote-source data.

**Avoid page reloads** when switching in between the panes because this significantly delays navigation in between panes. Remotely-loaded content using Ajax can be an option for dynamic and remotely-located pane information but presents a challenge for screen reader users who may not be aware of asynchronously DOM-inserted [nodes](https://www.howtocreate.co.uk/tutorials/javascript/dombasics "An explanation of how the Document Object Model works.") in the document's tree.</p>

### Use Short and Logical Names for Tab Control Text

Tab controls are meant to be as narrow as possible to accommodate multiple tabs without the need to lay them out in multiple rows.

Having shorter tab control text that content key words also makes it easier for readers who like to scan web pages or users who use in-page search for quickly finding content they're looking for.

It is also very important to use **relevant** and **logical key words** to describe the content of the panes, so the tab control text should be well thought out.

In the following example, you can see a poor implementation of module tabs on [CBS.com](https://www.cbs.com/ "This site probably does not care about screen reader users."). The tab control text is **not descriptive**, giving us **no context** of what to expect when switching to an inactive pane.

[![C B S dot com do not use descriptive tab control text making it hard to anticipate what content is.](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c9eca3a8-c447-4499-96da-3d2e97f51210/cbs-counter-example.jpg)](https://www.cbs.com/)

on the Navigant Consulting website, use numbers, whichÂ  can indicate an ordered sort for the data, but still do not convey what panes contain. It is ambiguous at best and can cause unneeded confusion with regards to the module tabs content.

![Navigant Consulting uses numbers for tab control text.](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/5a973a8a-164a-40e5-850d-61b526e143f1/navigant.jpg)

### Don't Use Scrolling Inside Panes

Scrollbars are an added encumbrance to users interacting with module tabs: to access the information that they are looking for, not only do they have to click on tab controls, but they also need to use scrollbars to see if the content they want is farther down the pane.

The need for scrollbars inside panes outlines an issue with regards to the length of the pane information or the design of the module tabs; either the content being presented is too long for the module tabs design pattern, or that the pane area is not tall enough for your content. Consider revising content for terseness, extending the height of the pane area, and/or allowing for variable height of the pane area depending on the pane information length of the active pane.</p>

## Module Tabs Accessibility Considerations

Web accessibility is currently one of the hottest topics. The advent of more complex user interaction, asynchronous content updates without a page refresh, and an enumerable number of ways which website content is viewed has made it difficult for certain individuals who have atypical needs for accessing websites. In this section, we shall talk about some accessibility issues you should keep in mind when building module tabs.</p>

### Use High-Contrast Colors for Active and Inactive Tabs

Users with **low-vision** must be able to see which tab control is the active tab control. Using highly contrasted background colors to distinguish the active tab control from the inactive tab control is good practice.

As a counter-example, the module tabs utilized in the Yahoo! News website has very little contrast between active and inactive tabs; they may be fine for sighted users, but can be troublesome for low-vision users.

![Yahoo! News colors make it hard for low-vision users.](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/21d397d5-d48d-4deb-8cf3-015c124a3578/yahoo-news.gif)

Also, make sure that the tab control text color (foreground) is sufficiently contrasted with the tab control color (background), even for inactive tab controls, so that users can easily read the text in inactive tabs. It is not a good idea to deemphasize inactive tab controls by graying them out.</p>

### Use Screen-Reader accessible Methods for Hiding Inactive Panes

To be accessible, module tabs should hide inactive panes using techniques that only hide them visually, but not remove them entirely from the DOM tree. For example, don't use display:none; or visibility:none; for hiding panes via CSS: these methods are not screen-reader accessible. See Roger Johansson's article called "[Hiding with CSS: Problems and solutions](https://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200905/hiding_with_css_problems_and_solutions/)".</p>

### Use a Semantic HTML Structure for Tab Controls

Placing the tab controls inside an unordered or ordered list improves accessibility because screen reader users are able to identify the tab controls as a set of elements. For tab controls that use images for tab control text, use ALT and/or TITLE properties with meaningful descriptions of what the tab controls say.</p>

### Allow Keyboard Navigation

Keyboard navigation accommodates individuals with **mobility impairments** that prevent them from using conventional input devices such as a mouse. It is essential that users that use alternative forms of site navigation (i.e. keyboard-based or voice-based) must be able to focus onto the tab controls in order for them to select and activate their desired pane.

An **easy way to test for keyboard navigation** is to use the Tab key on the web page that contains module tabs: check to see if you can focus in on each tab control. Pressing the Enter key when a tab control is focused on should result in the presentation of the target inactive pane, making it the active pane.</p>

### Ensure Graceful Degradation When Using Client-Side Technologies

Module tabs, at the very least, must degrade to web accessible content so that users who don't/can't use these technologies will still be able to access pane information. For JavaScript, check to make sure that content is viewable with the browser's JavaScript turned off. For Flash, serve an alternative for module tabs content, such as a text-based HTML page, for users who do not have the Flash plugin installed or who cannot interact with Flash objects.</p>

## Module Tab Enhancements

After covering recommendations and the basic features of a usable and web accessible module tabs we should also discuss some methods which you can use to further improve their usability.</p>

### Use Icons in Tab Controls to Create Visual Context for Pane Content

Using relevant icons that portray the content within the module tab panes is a great way of enhancing tab control context.

For example, in DrawIt, icons are used to add more context to what panes will contain.

![DrawIt uses icons in tab control text.](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2bc48f07-5a28-4b65-ab44-244027697535/drawit-example.jpg)

When using icons to enhance tab controls, make sure they are **relevant**; do not use icons solely for visual merits, which can counteract their purpose of improving content scanability and recognition.

**Avoid using icons to substitute tab control text** because symbols can mean different things to different people - the safest bet is using plain text to describe pane information.</p>

### Use Animation for Transitioning Between Panes

Using an animation effect when transitioning to another pane can be a great way to provide visual feedback that the active pane has changed.

For example, in the [Coda](https://www.panic.com/coda/) website, clicking on a tab control slides the panes left or right to reveal the requested pane content.

[![Coda uses animation to switch panes.](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/3733f85c-0e00-4b45-a8dd-8434954c523b/coda-icons.gif)](https://www.panic.com/coda/)

### Implement a Hover State for Inactive Tab Controls

Let users know that they **can click on tabs** by changing the mouse cursor property to a pointer. By default, this happens when users move their mouse cursor over hyperlinks, but you should make sure that this also happens when entering a tab control.

In addition, it's a good idea to change the tab control color of inactive tabs when the mouse cursor is brought over them. This can be useful in sites that attract **new computer users** who may be unfamiliar with module tabs interaction.

In the following example, [Vyniknite.sk](https://www.vyniknite.sk/) highlights inactive tabs with a red background when you mouse over inactive tab controls.

[![Vyniknite dot s k uses red highlights for hovers.](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/6fc44a8a-ef3c-46c2-ab36-aeb2edc18e05/vyniknite.gif)](https://www.vyniknite.sk/)
