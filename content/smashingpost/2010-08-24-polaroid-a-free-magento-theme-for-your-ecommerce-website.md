### Behind the design

As always, here are some insights from the designers:

<blockquote>We wanted to go beyond the boundaries of Magento and break the usual design patterns. We really wanted to try something new, add rich CSS3 features to the Magento theme and experiment a bit with its different features. We are very pleased to share this  theme with the community, especially with Smashing Magazine readers.   </blockquote>	  

Thank you, guys. We appreciate your work and your good intentions.</p>
