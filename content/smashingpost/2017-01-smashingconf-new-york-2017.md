### About The Conference

When we organize a conference, we make sure that it provides a lot of value for everybody involved. **We don’t care about volatile trends** and we don’t believe in overnight success stories. Every success requires hard work and many failures along the way. There are lessons learned, takeaways, and problems solved, but also many sketches and designs and ideas and prototypes thrown away because they didn’t work. **We're interested in how problems are solved**—ideas that failed, and _why_ exactly they failed and what decisions were chosen instead.
