If you've been assigned to design or provide the architecture for a large e-commerce project or other information-heavy website whose success depends on content findability, it is vital that the design and layout of the search functionality for that website is considered carefully.

<strong>The search results page</strong> is the prime focus of the search experience, and can make or break a site's conversion rates. Therefore, bridging the gap between a user and the content or products they seek is a crucial factor in the success of any large website. The responsibility to design an effective search results page is best considered after a thorough examination of some of the features and functions found on search results pages from a number of popular niches.

Be sure to check out our previous articles:

In this article, <strong>we'll look at a number of trends and practices incorporated on a variety of websites</strong>. From this examination, we'll conclude with a summary of the best practices learned from the examples those sites have set.

## 1\. Trends In Search Engines

<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=web+design+articles">Google's search result page</a> sets the pattern for all the search result pages we'll be considering. We'll list the primary features of Google's page, and then we'll point out some additional unique features found on other search results pages, including those found on the other popular search engines.</p>

### Google

[![Google](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/6fc8a716-587f-4423-84de-97095c71621b/google.jpg "Google")](https://www.google.com/search?q=web+design+articles)

<strong>Below are the primary features of Google's search results page:</strong>

*   Search box, with searched words, remains prominent at top
*   Option to view an "advanced" search page
*   Total number of results shown at top
*   Ajax-driven auto-complete for typed follow-up searches
*   Sponsored links at top and right
*   Paginated results
*   Results titles are large, bold, and hyperlinked
*   Searched words are shown in bold in a page snippet, in context
*   URLs shown in a different color under each result
*   Each result allows options to view "similar" and "cached"
*   Visited links are in a different color
*   Related search phrases listed at bottom
*   Search box with search terms repeated at the bottom
*   "Show options" link opens a sidebar for further filtering of the results

In the search engine niche, the other websites we're considering follow very similar patterns as those set above by Google, with a few variations. Here are some unique features of those search results pages that are not found on Google's.</p>

### Bing

[![Bing](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/1e5de612-4f3d-433a-be5d-eac61f54e2df/bing.jpg "Bing")](https://www.bing.com/search?q=web+design+articles)

Microsoft's new search engine <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=web+design+articles">Bing</a> lists the user's "search history" in the sidebar (outlined in red above), allowing the history to be cleared or turned off. The search history remains intact even when the browser is closed and the page is revisited.

Another helpful feature on Bing is shown below:

<a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=web+design+articles"><img title="Bing Pagination" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/5fe7459b-397b-4e6e-af1d-a9b73156630c/bing-pagination.jpg" alt="Bing Pagination" width="500" height="298" /></a>

The pagination unit at the bottom of the results page is more user-friendly than Google's version. While Google's version consists of "blocked" table cells, which somewhat help the clickability of these units, Bing's is much cleaner and a clearer distinction is made between paginated units. Also improving the usability, Bing's pagination units have a hover effect, which Google's doesn't, making Google's confusing as to which unit is being clicked.

Yahoo's search results page includes a couple of JavaScript-driven enhancements that improve on features of Google's and Bing's pages:

### Yahoo

[![Yahoo](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2c7a46af-355d-4a9e-8a36-af99333d2572/yahoo-slide-down.jpg "Yahoo")](https://search.yahoo.com/search?p=web+design+articles)

The <a href="https://search.yahoo.com/search?p=web+design+articles">search results page on Yahoo</a> displays an Ajax-driven slide-down unit that appears below the search box when a search query is being typed. This is similar to the Ajax drop-down featured on Google and Bing, but with a few extra enhancements.

Also, Yahoo offers two features still in Beta: "Search Pad", which allows the user to record notes on searches; and "SearchScan" to help protect from harmful websites:

[![Yahoo's Search Pad and Search Scan](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a156d7d2-a066-4f66-97a2-92254c6f23fd/yahoo-pad-scan.jpg "Yahoo's Search Pad and Search Scan")](https://search.yahoo.com/search?p=web+design+articles)

Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo have the experience and industry expertise to enable them to design an effective search results page. The patterns and trends they have set are worthy of consideration when designing your own search results page. Even if many of their features are out of your project's budget and scope, the principles behind those features can be considered and incorporated in practical ways.</p>

## 2\. Search Results In Video Sharing Sites

Search results pages on video-sharing websites have set important patterns worth noting. The search results page on top video-sharing sites contain many of the features that we've already mentioned under the "Search Engines" section, plus some additional features shown below.</p>

### YouTube

[![YouTube Filtering Options](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ecfd6b50-ee04-42de-b7c0-7c9541fed04b/youtube-filters.jpg "YouTube Filtering Options")](https://youtube.com/results?search_query=javascript+tutorial)

<a href="https://youtube.com/results?search_query=javascript+tutorial">YouTube</a> has easily-accessible filtering options near the top of the search results page, shown above. Additionally, each item on a YouTube search result page lists detailed information, including a thumbnail preview, running time of the clip, user rating, and age of the item:

[![YouTube Details](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/18602447-3beb-42da-8a12-ed5f5b703789/youtube-details.jpg "YouTube Details")](https://youtube.com/results?search_query=javascript+tutorial)

Also, if a particular item is part of a series, this is indicated:

[![YouTube Series](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/5ddad766-c784-492d-813a-7947171d414c/youtube-parts.jpg "YouTube Series")](https://youtube.com/results?search_query=javascript+tutorial)

### Metacafe

[![Metacafe Extra Features](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0a85ed22-6e02-4ce1-bae9-a9886941600e/metacafe-extras.jpg "Metacafe Extra Features")](https://www.metacafe.com/tags/javascript_tutorial/)

<a href="https://www.metacafe.com/tags/javascript_tutorial/">Metacafe</a> (above) includes many of the features that YouTube offers, plus an XML feed for a particular set of results, an option to enable or disable a "family filter", and a "more" link that takes the user to a search for related content.</p>

### Veoh

[![Veoh Grid](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/be603578-d782-4952-8228-e0a3db21387d/veoh-grid.jpg "Veoh Grid")](https://www.veoh.com/search/videos/q/pc+mac)

<a href="https://www.veoh.com/search/videos/q/pc+mac">Veoh's search result page</a> (above) displays the items in grid format, which differs from the one-item-per-row or "list" format of the search results pages we've considered so far. Veoh also includes a button to "add to interests", as well as a "Related Searches" box at the top of the results (although those related items were never very practical in the searches I conducted):

[![Veoh Extras](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/3f9bae29-87da-4272-9bef-ee7b7440d474/veoh-extras.jpg "Veoh Extras")](https://www.veoh.com/search/videos/q/pc+mac)

### Break

[![Break Top 10](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/992f95ec-a5c6-470e-a36e-1d0f7b5d6022/break-top.jpg "Break Top 10")](https://my.break.com/Content/Search/Search.aspx?s=pc+mac)

<a href="https://my.break.com/Content/Search/Search.aspx?s=pc+mac">Break.com's search results page</a> (above) includes a "Top 10 Searches" box on the right side of the page, allowing the user to view what others have been searching for.</p>

## 3\. Search Results in Social News & Mini-Blogging

Many sites that offer user-driven news, mini-blogging, and bookmarking offer search results pages with unique features. Here are a few examples:

### Twitter

[![Twitter](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/87f9089e-8cbf-4ff7-91ad-048bb4d23eab/twitter.jpg "Twitter")](https://twitter.com/#search?q=photoshop%20tutorials)

<a href="https://twitter.com/#search?q=photoshop%20tutorials">Twitter</a> (above) offers a very clean, intuitive JavaScript-driven interface that includes "Realtime" results. Their page also offers a list of "Trending topics" and a "Search tip" box:

[![Twitter Extras](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f4ae75d5-222b-48b6-9837-2201ad34098b/twitter-tips.jpg "Twitter Extras")](https://twitter.com/#search?q=photoshop%20tutorials)

Additionally, Twitter gives the user the option to refresh the page after it detects additional results in real time, shown in the yellow box below:

[![Twitter More Results](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/6d56883b-ca97-4b19-b353-0957c4956d87/twitter-more.jpg "Twitter More Results")](https://twitter.com/#search?q=photoshop)

### Digg

[![Digg Comments](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/09a8842e-4a41-4f2d-a8f8-1bf1b9f31566/digg-comments.jpg "Digg Comments")](https://digg.com/search?s=css+tutorial)

Each result on the <a href="https://digg.com/search?s=css+tutorial">Digg search results page</a> (above) includes the number of comments that have been posted for that particular story, in addition to other features that are unique to Digg, including "share" and "bury".</p>

### Delicious

[![Delicious Tags](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2f94ceb7-0eac-4b0a-b137-b173f6594d02/delicious-tags.jpg "Delicious Tags")](https://delicious.com/search?p=css)

<a href="https://delicious.com/search?p=css">Delicious</a> lists search results in a very simple, list format that includes tags associated with each result, plus the number of times the result has been bookmarked.</p>

## 4\. Search in Merchandise & E-Commerce

An effective and user-friendly search results page is crucial to the success of an e-commerce website, since that is the means by which most users will attempt to find content. Let's look at some unique features on search results pages from popular e-commerce sites.</p>

### Amazon

[![Amazon Sort Option](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d6544cd4-d863-466d-ac01-a799638cea22/amazon-sort.jpg "Amazon Sort Option")](https://www.amazon.com/s/?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=graphic+design)

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=graphic+design">Amazon's search results page</a> (above) allows for the results to be sorted based on a variety of methods, including "Bestselling" and "Avg. Customer Review". This is done by means of a <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> box that adds or removes sorting options based on the department the user is currently viewing.

When displaying results for books, Amazon's results page indicates if a book has the "Look Inside" feature. There is also a brief excerpt from each book, plus links to view other editions of the same item:

[![Amazon Extras](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/bde710c1-fd1e-4f71-82d9-c7d999689741/amazon-extras.jpg "Amazon Extras")](https://www.amazon.com/s/?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=design+everyday+things)

### eBay

<a href="https://books.shop.ebay.com/i.html?_nkw=javascript&amp;_sacat=267&amp;_trksid=p3286.m270.l1313&amp;_odkw=javascript&amp;_osacat=0">eBay's search results page</a> (above) allows for easy filtering via tabs at the top. eBay also provides a unique feature at the bottom of the page: the option to view the thumbnail preview images in a different size:

[![eBay Picture Size Option](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f107f1c3-9e60-405c-81c8-88ec1c9262b1/ebay-thumbs.jpg "eBay Picture Size Option")](https://books.shop.ebay.com/i.html?_nkw=javascript&_sacat=267&_trksid=p3286.m270.l1313&_odkw=javascript&_osacat=0)

<a href="https://www.walmart.com/search/search-ng.do?search_constraint=0&amp;ic=48_0&amp;search_query=jeans">Walmart's search results page</a> clearly distinguishes between products available in-store and those only available online, allowing the user to filter items through a tabbed interface.

There is also an option to toggle the search results view between "grid" and "list":

[![Walmart View Toggler](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/fdaf4aea-daa3-4419-84fc-94db518d8cbf/walmart-view.jpg "Walmart View Toggler")](https://www.walmart.com/search/search-ng.do?search_constraint=0&ic=48_0&search_query=jeans)

The bottom of Walmart's search results page includes links to items that were purchased after other shoppers conducted the same search. There is also a feedback option offered, indicating that Walmart is conducting ongoing analyses of user interaction with their search features:

[![Walmart Search Results Options](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/46dfa5cf-b9fb-4991-8e40-b28165d30465/walmart-bottom.jpg "Walmart Search Results Options")](https://www.walmart.com/search/search-ng.do?search_constraint=0&ic=48_0&search_query=jeans)

In addition to the features on the e-commerce search pages discussed in the previous section, below are some examples of practical features found on a few less-popular e-commerce sites.</p>

### Coast

[![Coast New Product](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/759a1a4d-86dc-4168-8e57-77d78681e252/coast-new.jpg "Coast New Product")](https://www.coast-stores.com/search?keywords=pearl+necklace)

"Window" format puts all items into a JavaScript-driven scrolling window-like element. Shoon also lists alternative color options for the individual products. Clicking a new color option changes the product photo dynamically via JavaScript.</p>

### Eddie Bauer

[![Eddie Bauer Light Box](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7089fb8d-3c89-472f-affd-42f50ebec45d/eddiebauer-lightbox.jpg "Eddie Bauer Light Box")](https://www.eddiebauer.com/catalog/search.jsp?N=0&Ntk=IALL&Ntt=sweater&Nr=REG%3aY&Nty=1&Ntx=mode+matchpartialmax&D=sweater&Dx=mode+matchpartialmax&cm_se=sweater_All&init=1#ppl=%7Btype%3A%22transition%22%2CensembleId%3A%2235690%22%2CformatStr%3A%22product%22%2CpassedIdObj%3A%7B%22ensembleId%22%3A%2235690%22%7D%2CcategoryId%3A%22null%22%2CpathInfo%3A%22T307%22%2CcolorId%3A%22026%22%2CsizeIdSelected%3A%22-1%22%2CquantitySelected%3A%22-1%22%2CimageName%3A%22null%22%2CimageTypeCode%3A%22null%22%2CcatPath%3A%22null%22%2Ccs%3A%220%22%7D)

Inside the light box window the user is able to take advantage of a number of practical functions including product zooming, size selection, related product display, and shopping cart options.</p>

## 5\. Search Results on Photo Sharing Sites

Photo sharing sites offer a few helpful features on their search results pages. Below are some examples.</p>

### Flickr

[![Flickr Views Options](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c1753201-e6eb-408a-ab8d-610fd358b98a/flickr-views.jpg "Flickr Views Options")](https://www.flickr.com/search/show/?q=beach)

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/search/?q=beach">Flickr</a> (above) displays results by default in a simple grid-based format, and they include some of the filtering options we've already discussed. Flickr also allows the images to be displayed either in a detail-heavy list-style view or inside of a Flash-based slideshow gallery.</p>

### PhotoBucket

[![Photobucket Filters and Follow](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f4dabffb-fa3c-4799-9e57-6485e5f5ca5f/photobucket-options.jpg "Photobucket Filters and Follow")](https://photobucket.com/images/sunset)

<a href="https://photobucket.com/images/sunset">Photobucket</a> (above) allows filtering of search results by "Most viewed" and "Most commented". It also includes a link strangely titled "Follow", which allows the user to enter their email address to receive notifications when the results for a particular search term are updated. A more appropriate title for this feature would be "Subscribe", or similar.</p>

## 6\. Search Results on Technology-Related Sites

Naturally, technology and web-related sites should have strong usability and functionality on their search results pages. These types of sites can incorporate more complex functionality due to their tech-savvy readership, however, care should be taken to make sure any complex features are practical and do not hinder the user experience.</p>

### Adobe

[![Adobe Search Results](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f3edc5f7-7949-4fdb-bf71-1b7beab405fe/adobe-extras.jpg "Adobe Search Results")](https://www.adobe.com/cfusion/search/index.cfm?term=cs4)

<a href="https://www.apple.com/search/?q=ipod">The Apple search results page</a> (above) includes promotional boxes displaying featured items related to the search terms entered by the user. Then, under the promotional boxes, list-style results are displayed under different headings ("Products", "Downloads", etc) so that results are associated with relevant sections of the website:

[![Apple Search Sections](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4e611b23-688d-47e2-a469-06664d1cf03c/apple-sections.jpg "Apple Search Sections")](https://www.apple.com/search/?q=ipod)
