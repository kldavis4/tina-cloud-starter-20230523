### Insights From The Designers

<blockquote>"This is an iconset conceived to fill up the void in responsive-design-related icons, beyond the usual representation of three devices with the same layout that's usually presented more like a whole illustration. Considering the minimum level of detail required, and the design trends of the times, the style opted for was a mixture of outlined and flat, beyond simply rendering stroked and filled icons, giving each color area intention and meaning, as well as crafting two colorschemes, one with full warm colors and other with a cold reduced palette. Finally, to provide a complete and articulated pack, icons for mobile design, use and interaction were added, such as gestures and connection options."</blockquote>

A big thank you to Juan Pablo Sarmiento â€” we sincerely appreciate your time and efforts. Keep up the brilliant work!
