  When you hear the word "creative", what type of profession comes to mind?
  Maybe a graphic designer, painter, sculptor, illustrator, or writer? It's
  unlikely that you would consider a "programmer" when thinking of creative
  fields of work. But programmers have the potential to be creative and come up
  with ideas or concepts that will impact others in positive ways.

  We often turn to programmers to solve mathematical-related problems, but the
  concept of mathematics in programming is what powers programmers to innovate.
  When you think of mathematics you imagine numbers, expressions, and equations.
  But what about art, music, or even beautiful visuals? Those numbers and
  equations that we often view as mundane and overly-formulaic can generate
  beautiful visuals and music. This article will present **dozens of examples of
  motion graphics and interactive visuals created with computational code**,
  along with some useful references and resources.

## Free Applications for Creating Visuals with Computational Code

### Processing

<a href="https://processing.org/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/79de3e84-a629-489e-adde-1959c0345c54/processing.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="500" height="300" /></a>

Processing is a popular and powerful application for generating visuals using programming. It's free and open source and uses Java as its coding language. It's been used in professional, educational, and scientific environments and is available for GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. It can also be used for web by embedding as Java applets or through the use of <a href="https://processingjs.org/">Processing.js</a>, which uses JavaScript to draw shapes and manipulate images using the HTML5 Canvas element. Processing is also available for Java-based mobiles (Mobile Processing).

*   [Processing with Eclipse](https://backspaces.net/29/processing-with-eclipse/) If you are an avid Java programmer and have been using Eclipse for your daily routine this would be best way to use Processing, making your workspace comfortable and familiar. Another benefit that Eclipse adds is that you can harness the power of the latest Java IDE.</p>

### Quartz Composer

<a href="https://developer.apple.com/graphicsimaging/quartz/quartzcomposer.html"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/3f2f64af-d9b9-4b6d-9a0e-7a04a18abd90/qc.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="500" height="300" /></a>

Popular among Mac developers and VJs, Quartz Composer is the simplest application for creating still as well interactive motion graphics. It uses a node-based sequencing visual programming language that takes advantage of the Open GL, JavaScript, Core Image and Core Video devices and other technologies built into Mac OS X. It's intended for non-programmers and is used by developers to construct user interfaces in conjunction with Cocao and other developer tools bundled in Xcode. It's also used to create iTunes Music Visualizers.

Using third-party tools like <a href="https://www.pixlock.com/">Effect Builder AE</a> and <a href="https://www.chv-plugins.com/cms/FxPlug/QC-Integration/QC-Integration.php">QC Integration FX</a> you can turn your Quartz compositions into plug-ins for professional video editing / motion graphics applications such as Apple Final Cut, Adobe After Effects, Apple Motion, etc., without writing a single line of code. Many professional applications like Pixelmator use Quartz Composer on Mac to generate graphics and this is one of the reasons why some graphics processing application are available only for Mac OS X. As you probably guessed, Quartz Composer is only available for Mac OS X. Users of Mac OS X 10.6 or later can utilize OpenCL in Quartz Composers.

### OpenFrameworks

<a href="https://www.openframeworks.cc"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/970ab608-41c9-496c-9ca7-24eb2e4c9b68/openframework.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="500" height="300" /></a>

<a href="https://www.openframeworks.cc">OpenFrameworks</a> is a tool for creating interactive visuals, and is widely used among creative programmers. The user interface is simple and similar to that of Processing. Similar to Processing, it uses libraries, but it's difficult to find third-party libraries and requires knowledge of C++ programming.

*   [Start Up Guide](https://wiki.openframeworks.cc/index.php?title=OF_Start_Up_Guide)
*   [OpenFrameworks Forum](https://www.openframeworks.cc/forum/)
*   [OpenFrameworks Wiki](https://wiki.openframeworks.cc)

### NodeBox

<a href="https://www.nodebox.net"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/054db11e-4beb-4ba7-9743-6e67eb2c8d79/nodebox.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="500" height="300" /></a>

<a href="https://www.nodebox.net">NodeBox</a> is similar to Processing and OpenFrameworks with the only major difference being the programming language used, which is Python. Although NodeBox has a small number of libraries in comparison with Processing, they are of good quality. NodeBox supports PDF, QuickTime movies, fonts and uses the Mac OS X Core Image library for image manipulations (blend modes, color changes, filters etc). NodeBox is available only for Mac OS X.

*   [NodeBox Library](https://nodebox.net/code/index.php/Library) A collection of libraries, add-ons, and extensions.</p>

### VVVV

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c3549cd1-ad27-4906-adf6-ac68f8d75c21/vvvv.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="500" height="300" />

VVVV is usually used in large media environments like concerts and art installations for real-time motion graphics, video and audio processing and interactive motion graphics. Unlike Quartz Composer, VVVV comes with audio synthesis, 3D Mesh manipulation, and real-time video synthesis built in. It is a powerful application for generating visuals in real-time, even at very high resolution and high frame-rates.

Another important feature of VVVV is that it can make use of multiple computers behaving in sync. All programming and editing can be done on one server computer, while all client computers execute their respective tasks. You can easily use the CPU and GPU power of each computer to do some amazing effects at a cheaper cost. Since VVVV uses DirectX, it's only available for Windows.

*   [Strukt](https://www.strukt.com/) Strukt has done many projects using VVVV, including this beautiful [letter universe installation](https://vimeo.com/3765704).</p>

### eMotion

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0ba62766-679a-4d81-aced-cb9353519b87/emotion.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="500" height="300" />

eMotion is a new free application which can generate real-time as well as offset graphics. It has an awesome text and particle engine which is driven by real-world physics. It is available only for Mac OS X.</p>

<a href="https://vimeo.com/706938">Reverse Shadow Theatre</a> by <a href="https://vimeo.com/gabor">Gabor Papp</a>
Amazing example in which the code powers the real-time puppet animation. Uses multiple software - Processing, Eyesweb and Animata. Both Eyesweb and <a href="https://animata.kibu.hu">Animata</a> are open source, as is Processing. Here Eyesweb handles the motion tracking while Animata takes in the input data from Eyesweb and does the real-time animation. Also watch <a href="https://vimeo.com/664556">Jazz Pub</a>.</p>
