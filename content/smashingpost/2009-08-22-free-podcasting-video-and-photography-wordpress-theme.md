The word limit can be adjusted independently for sticky (featured) posts or multimedia posts on the front page and on category pages.

### Update (24/08/2009)

The problem with the js is fixed. It was the missing call to the wp_footer(); also, removed the js file that was not needed. Please make sure when you import the sample data that you check the "Download Attachments" when importing!

Everyone has their own opinion of what constitues a decent free WordPress Theme which I appreciate.

In view of that, you may not be particularly excited about the colour, font or other design choices ( including spelling ;) ) and you may decide, as some of you have already done so, to express this in your comments below.

While you do so, it is my sincere wish that some of you may take a moment and appreciate the effort that went into things like: the Theme Options, the custom write panels, the custom video shortcodes, that if I may add output valid html code, and the time taken to write and comment out, what I believe is, decent html/css code."

Thank you very much, Sarah! We really appreciate your efforts.
