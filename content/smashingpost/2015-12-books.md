### Design Systems (October 2017)

As the web continuously becomes more complex, designing static pages has become untenable, so that many of us have started to approach design in a modular way. In this book, Alla Kholmatova will identify what makes an **effective design system** that empowers teams to create great digital products.

### About The Book

Many of us have started to approach design in a more modular way recently. It's just more manageable this way. We experiment with pattern libraries and style guides and almighty design systems, yet while some of us succeed, most of us fail. Our systems **get out-of-date too quickly** or just don't get enough traction in our companies. It's about time to fix it.

Not all design systems are equally effective. Some can generate coherent user experiences, others produce confusing patchwork designs. Some inspire teams to contribute to them, while others are neglected. Some get better with time, more cohesive and better functioning; others get worse, becoming bloated and cumbersome.

Throughout this book, Alla Kholmatova, previously a lead designer at _FutureLearn_, will share an approach and the key qualities of effective, enduring design systems. It's based on Alla's experiences, case-studies from AirBnB, Atlassian, Eurostar, TED, and Sipgate, plus 18 months of research and interviews — all attempting to figure out what works and what doesn't work in real-life products. It may not answer every question, but it will help you figure out just the right **strategy for establishing and evolving a design system** in your organization.

### Who The Book Is For

The book is aimed mainly at **small and medium-sized product teams** trying to integrate modular thinking into their organization’s culture. Everyone in the product team could benefit from reading this book, but particularly visual and interaction designers, UX practitioners, and front-end developers.

The result is now for you to judge. Printed hardcover, 280 pages. Reviewed by Karen McGrane and Jeremy Keith. Cover design by Espen Brunborg. [Get the book now.](https://smashing-magazine.myshopify.com/cart/41903490956:1)

### Testimonials

It has been our goal to make the book **as practical and useful as possible**. We've been honored to receive very positive reviews from people working on design systems on small and large scale.

*   “Alla’s book outlines a process not just for creating a design system, but _sustaining_ it over time. If you work on today’s web, I’d **strongly recommend** reading this insightful, approachable book.”
    _— Ethan Marcotte, Designer_

*   “_Design Systems_ is essential reading for all designers and design teams. Like great design – and effective systems – this book is a complete, connected, compelling guide for crafting great digital product experiences. No single resource has been more integral to our thinking about design systems than Alla’s book.”
    _— Jon Bell, Design manager, MailChimp_

*   “Alla’s thoughtful analysis of systems-oriented thinking is a fundamental primer for anyone looking to establish a universal language across their team or organization.”
    _— Bethany Sonefeld, Design lead, Carbon Design System, IBM_

*   “The magic of this book is its recognition that building a design system is as much about forming human connections as it is about technical solutions. It embraces the hard problems, and clears a path to help teams work towards a shared, cohesive vision.”
    _— Amy Thibodeau, UX lead, Polaris Design System, Shopify_

*   “Great designers make equally great writers because they are meticulous. This superb introduction to design systems is written with the **meticulous care the subject deserves**.”
    _— Heydon Pickering, Author of [Inclusive Design Patterns](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/inclusive-design-patterns/)_

### What's In The Book

The book explores design systems from the perspective of an interaction and visual designer. You won’t find any code samples or in-depth analysis of development tools. The book looks both into the **main building blocks** of a system and the **workflow** that would support the integrity of the system — all applied to designing and building websites or products today.

“Design Systems” is about how to approach your design process more systematically, and ensure your design system helps to achieve the purpose of your product and fits with the culture of your team.

The book consists of two parts:

#### Part 1: Foundations

In the first part, we’ll talk about the foundations of a design system – **patterns and practices**. Design patterns are repeatable, reusable parts of the interface, from the concrete and functional (like buttons and text fields) to the more descriptive (like iconography styles, colors, and typography). Patterns interconnect, and together they form the language of your product’s interface.

Shared practices are how we choose to create, capture, share and use those patterns by following a set of principles, or by keeping a pattern library.

*   Chapter 1: Design Systems
*   Chapter 2: Design Principles
*   Chapter 3: Functional Patterns
*   Chapter 4: Perceptual Patterns
*   Chapter 5: Shared Language
*   Summary

#### Part 2: Process

A design system cannot be built overnight – it evolves gradually with your product. But, there are certain principles and practices that we can follow to make sure the system develops in the right direction and provides us some degree of control over it. The second part of the book focuses on practical steps and **techniques to establish and maintain** a design system, including planning the work; conducting an interface inventory; setting up a pattern library; creating, documenting, evolving and maintaining design patterns.

*   Chapter 6: Parameters Of Your System
*   Chapter 7: Planning And Practicalities
*   Chapter 8: Systemizing An Interface: Functional Patterns
*   Chapter 9: Systemizing An Interface: Perceptual Patterns
*   Chapter 10: Pattern Libraries: What, Why And How
*   Conclusion

### White Hat UX (August 2017)

Most things in life come with a dark side. For years, the online space has acted as a playground for thieves, bandits and murky types who will use every trick in the book to make you do the opposite of what you set out to do. But there is hope. The next generation in user experience is coming.

_White Hat UX - The Next Generation in User Experience_ is the right book for you when you find yourself in one of the following situations:

*   You’re not trained in UX, yet you now have the responsibility for it
*   You struggle to follow along in the conversations about user experience in your team
*   You are a manager and want to understand how your company can become leaders in the modern digital market (hint: serving a great user experience is a competitive advantage)
*   You want to learn about ethical design but you’re not sure where to start

White Hat UX starts by defining UX - done in a straightforward way that allows people with limited UX knowledge to gain a clear understanding of the field.

It shows and tells what many companies do wrong (either by intent or stupidity).

It describes how privacy is being violated, and what consequences it has for the businesses that will keep doing so because they think it’s good business (and because they don’t care about people).

And finally, it explains how you improve the user experience of your product, service and company to gain the most powerful competitive advantage in today’s consumer driven market: a White Hat, honest user experience. Also, you’ll sleep better at night knowing you are doing the right thing.

### User Experience Revolution (April 2017)

Many companies try to create a great experience for customers. However, few are willing to make the changes required to deliver on that promise. In fact, most companies don’t even realize how bad their experience can be. This is why we made a new book called “User Experience Revolution,” a **practical battle plan for placing the user at the heart of your company**. <span style="color:#999">(Image credit: [<span style="color:#999">Artem Pereverzev</span>‏](https://twitter.com/clartem/status/855128196802637824))</span>

<p class="desc"><span class="lead">Summary</span> <span>&bull;</span> The first chapter gives you a compact overview of the most important features of the design app, as well as an introduction to the interface of Sketch. Mainly, you will get a short peek into its best features: Sketch is easy to learn, fast and lightweight, it has a clean, uncluttered UI, grids are built right in, it provides powerful export options, lets you easily adapt your design to different sizes, and most of all: Sketch is vector based. Everything you build is indefinitely scalable &mdash; a must with today's vast array of devices.

<tr class="infobox"><td colspan="2">
<p class="desc"><span class="lead">Summary</span> <span>&bull;</span> The first screen we tackle is the details page. Everything starts here with the artboards which give your design a defined space. After you have added the first elements and text layers, you can read how to style them and change their properties. This includes an overview of the available shapes and fill types, as well as the usage of images. With the first layers appearing in the layers list, it&rsquo;s also important to learn the best way to organize them. Lastly, you will employ an 8-px-grid, that gives the design some structure and avoids random placement of the elements.

<p class="desc"><span class="lead">Summary</span> <span>&bull;</span> A design is never finished, so we will use artboards to evolve its elements and try out different ideas. You will learn about symbols and shared styles that allow you to reuse elements and keep them in sync. This chapter also comes with some advanced techniques, such as masks, shadows, gradients, and boolean operations. The latter are especially important, as they let you combine basic shapes to form complex objects. This is also the first touch point with plugins to enhance Sketch. To round things up, we will have a look at how easy it is to recreate an icon in the design app.

### Testimonials From Our Readers

<ul><li>&ldquo;I have been using Sketch for a while but wanted this to understand the software at a more foundational level rather than just diving head first into it. The book is organized in a manner that it is simple at the beginning and gets more complex as you progress. The writing is crisp, clear and the author does well what he set out to do - impart his Sketch knowledge to folks who want to know more about it. I highly recommend it for people who want a great foundation and an effective bunch of lessons. &rdquo;<br /><em>&mdash; Justin Watts</em></li>
<br><li>&ldquo;At first look I can see I'm going to get heaps of value from The Sketch Handbook. Already picked up some tips just by skim reading. I ordered the hardcover as a reference book for the studio. Can't wait to get deeper into Sketch. Christian obviously knows his stuff! &rdquo;<br /><em>&mdash; Simon Uxer</em></li>

### Inclusive Design Patterns (October 2016)

**Accessibility** has always been a slightly unsettling realm for web developers. Surrounded with myths, misunderstandings and contradicting best practices, it used to be a domain for a small group of experts who would "add" accessibility on top of the finished product. Today, in many simple and complex websites, it’s still **unclear what makes up an accessible interface** and what developers need to know to get there.

<figure><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4527db4e-fa2c-4e98-8a49-e7c286b873ab/paper-aerial-opt.png" width="500" height="335" alt="Alt-Text" /></a><figcaption>The book doesn’t cover the code alone, but also the process for inclusive prototyping, to get things right from the very start. CSS may be the way the interface looks and JavaScript may be how it behaves, but HTML is the interface. [Get the eBook right away!](https://smashing-magazine.myshopify.com/cart/23316415366:1)</figcaption></figure>

So let’s get to the bottom of it all: accessibility myths and rules of thumbs, WAI-ARIA roles, content accessibility guidelines, landmark roles, keyboard and touch accessibility, accessible markup and interaction patterns, accessible forms and widgets, multimedia accessibility and inclusive prototyping. **Everything you need to know about accessibility** gathered in one practical, _smashing_ book, fully dedicated to building and designing accessible user interfaces.



Written by [Heydon Pickering](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/heydon-pickering/), the book comes with dozens of practical examples of accessible interface components and inclusive design workflow, applicable to your work right away. With this book, you’ll know _exactly_ how to keep interfaces accessible from the very start, and how to design and build inclusive websites without hassle and unnecessary code.

### Why An Accessibility Book?

We make inaccessible and unusable websites and apps all the time, but it’s not for lack of skill or talent. It’s just a case of doing things the wrong way. We try to build the best experiences we can, but we only make them for ourselves and people like us. We’ve got to fix this for good.

That’s why we set out with Heydon to work on a new accessibility book. The result, the _Inclusive Design Patterns_ book looks at **common accessible interface patterns** from the perspective of an _inclusive_ designer—someone trained in building experiences that cater to the huge diversity of abilities, preferences and circumstances out there.

There’s no such thing as an ‘average’ user, but there is such a thing as an average developer. This book will take you from average to expert in the area that matters the most: making things more readable and more usable to more people.

Many web design articles and books are all about improving your workflow and making your life easier as a developer. Should you wish to adopt a framework or employ a processor to speed up your development process, be our guest. However, this book is not about you; it’s about your _audience_.

The _Inclusive Design Patterns_ book covers all the techniques, gotchas and strategies you need to be aware of when building accessible, inclusive interfaces. We’ll explore the document outline, external links and "skip" links, navigation regions and landmarks, labelling and alternative text for illustrations, buttons, tables of contents, JavaScript patterns, touch targets, filter widgets and infinite scrolling and "load more" button and grid display and dynamic content and tab interfaces and password validation and web forms and error messages — and pretty much anything else you need to know about accessibility, including how to prototype with inclusivity in mind, how to deal with legacy browsers and dozens of practical snippets to use when building inclusive interfaces.

What’s in it for you? You can take away Heydon’s lessons learned and apply them within any framework sufficiently flexible to allow you to write and organize good interfaces. One thing is certain: once you read the book, accessibility won’t appear difficult nor confusing any longer — you’ll know exactly what to do, and when.

#### Table Of Contents

You’ve probably guessed it — the book doesn’t deal with theoretical concepts or things that are supposed to work. The book deals with practical design patterns and common interface components, and provides ready-to-use code snippets for applying to your work right away.

### Table Of Contents

You've probably guessed it — the book doesn't deal with theoretical concepts or things that are supposed to work. The book deals with **practical design patterns and common interface components**, and provides ready-to-use code snippets for applying to your work right away.

#### Introduction

<span class="lead">Summary</span> <span>•</span> We will look at an interactive element, a button, from the perspective of three types of designers. The purpose of this example is to show you how a little bit of knowledge about the medium can lead to a simpler and (therefore) more inclusive solution.

#### 1. The Document

<span class="lead">Summary</span> <span>•</span> We will look into discrete interface patterns; modules, components, widgets, conventions, whatever-you-want-to-call-thems. It would be foolhardy not to first acknowledge that each will ultimately belong to a web document. HTML pages vary dramatically in shape and size and can include any combination of patterns, but there are a handful of 'document level' best practices to which we should adhere. The aim here is not to go in search of the ultimate 'boilerplate' but to configure a parent web page to support inclusive design. nhancement

#### 2. A Paragraph

<span class="lead">Summary</span> <span>•</span> We'll be looking at typefaces, leading, measure, justification, contrast, focus indication and more, to help you design paragraphs suited for a hugely diverse audience. We'll also tackle specific issues for folks with limited vision, dyslexia, Irlen syndrome, low literacy and limited technical knowledge.

#### 3. A Blog Post

<span class="lead">Summary</span> <span>•</span> We'll show how to incorporate accessible landmarks and a sound section structure to make the content more navigable and interoperable to a diversity of users and parsers. This will be bolstered by giving well-written and context independent structural as well asand context independent structural and navigational cues.

#### 4. Navigation

<span class="lead">Summary</span> <span>•</span> We'll progressively enhance HTML's primitives to create the inclusive means to navigate within and between web pages. We will also cover design provisions transferable to many other patterns, including logical source order and the virtue of eliminating redundancy. We will also tackle how to progressively enhance the navigation with JavaScript.

#### 5. A Menu Button

<span class="lead">Summary</span> <span>•</span> In this chapter, we'll ensure our menu button and the content it reveals are inclusive of differing user settings, circumstances, devices, and assistive technology software.

#### 6. Inclusive Prototyping

<span class="lead">Summary</span> <span>•</span> By going straight from paper to HTML, we lay the foundations for efficient code and inclusive experiences.

#### 7. A List Of Products

<span class="lead">Summary</span> <span>•</span> In this chapter, we'll practice our inclusive design chops. As in previous patterns, the organization and structure of content is paramount. We'll look deeply into image accessibility, from both the perspectives of alternative text composition and performance. In catering to blind consumers, to those who cannot afford generous data contracts, and anyone accessing your content from outside your interface, this is a chance to really push the limits of inclusive design.

#### 8. A Filter Widget

<span class="lead">Summary</span> <span>•</span> We'll explore the importance of giving users choice and control over how their content is arranged. We'll also use some techniques to make sure our design was tolerant of dynamic and fluctuating content. Inclusive design also means a visual design which is not too strict about the nature of the content imparted to it.

#### 9. A Registration Form

<span class="lead">Summary</span> <span>•</span> This chapter will give you everything you need to develop inclusive forms. By using standard form elements, effective labeling and facilitating the correction of errors, users of all walks are able to access and contribute to your websites and apps. By keeping the form simple and avoiding irritating experiences like disappearing labels and passwords that you cannot check, we've made sure using the form isn't just possible but pleasurable.

#### 10. Test-driven Markup

<span class="lead">Summary</span> <span>•</span> Test-driven development allows developers working with frequent iterations to move forward with confidence. By writing tests first, to prescribe outcomes, then creating the functionality to achieve them, you can ensure successful builds behave in a predictable and reliable fashion.

As designers and developers, we solve problems for a living. Yet, these problems are often quite tricky and complex, and the context of these problems requires us to be creative and flexible in our workflows. With responsive design, we are prompted to create scalable design systems that work well in unpredictable environments. To do that, we need to be pragmatic and find solutions that work well within given constraints. That’s why we created this book: to find techniques that have actually worked in real-life projects with <strong>real-world challenges</strong>.</p>

In fact, melding of responsive design techniques is absolutely possible.<br /><br />In this chapter, Fabio, the technical email maestro from <em>Mailchimp</em>, explores what you can achieve with <strong>media queries in responsive HTML email</strong> to ensure that your emails look just fine on major email clients across different devices, and looks even better in clients that do not support media queries (such as <strong>Gmail</strong>).</p>

### Digital Adaptation

Nothing is more frustrating than **stubborn management** entangled in dated workflows and inefficient processes. That's why we created _Digital Adaptation_, a new practical book on how to help senior management understand the Web and adapt the business, culture, team structure and workflows accordingly. No fluff, no theory — just techniques and strategies that worked in practice, and showed results.
