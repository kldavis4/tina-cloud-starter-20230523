Sometimes <strong>laptop</strong> is more than just a device. Using laptops over years, some of us tend to develop <strong>a genuine affection</strong> toward their little (or not so little) companions. We take care of them, putting them in a nice hand-made fabric, spicing them up with some fancy outfit and providing them with a personality using laptop skins. That's not as bad as it sounds, and there are many ways to use laptop decoration (or laptops decorated by other people) as a source of inspiration. In some way you may also call it <em>laptop art</em>. 

In this issue of Monday inspiration series we provide you with some <strong>fresh ideas to spice up your environment with laptop skins, engravings, sleeves, cases and stickers</strong>. At the end of this post you'll also find some experimental ideas for laptop decoration — caution, you don't want to replicate them at home or office — well, at least if you care about your laptop.

You may also want to take a look at the following related posts:

Apparently, Apple geeks are far more sensitive when it comes to accessories for their laptops — although we've tried to cover as many different ideas as possible, in the selection below many of the presented ideas are used on Macs. There is nothing we can do about it, really.

## Laptop Skins and Engravings

Shalgo Laptop Designs

MacBook skin

In most cases you can use your own skin designs and let some skin printing store print them out for you. That was the case here.

## Laptop Bags and Sleeves

Designer’s Bag Case

This is sexy. A notebook-bag case for “thin” laptops.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/3623c063-aece-47dc-8e1a-aa797bf44e21/bagcase.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="450" height="422" />

E.square 60s-style laptop bags

Laptop bags weren't around in the 1960s, but if they were, they would possibly look like these E.square 60s-style laptop bags. Price: $54.95.

Thorn Berry's Laptop Sleeve

A hand-made laptop sleeve with a layer of wadding between the outer fabric and the lining. And with the designer's name on it. Gorgeous!

Terry Laptop Case

A juicy laptop case for geeky girls out there. Price: $125.

Pinguins Leather MacBook Sleeve

Folds around the laptop. Unfolded it functions as workspace with an integrated mousepad.

Seejanework Cases

Looks like a CD-storage, but it is a pretty cozy laptop sleeve.

Giles Miller's corrugated cardboard laptop case

Sturdy, stylish, and sustainable. This cardboard is 100% recycled. You can also personalize it with custom designs such as one's initials (or an apple logo — as shown here).

Eoin McNally's Packaging Case

The idea is people should recycle the cardboard that their laptops arrive in by reshaping them it into a protective carrying sleeve. The cardboard casing your computer ships in is treated with natural wax to protect it from spills and as an alternative to the usual polystyrene foam peanuts. We're not sure we would actually use the handle to carry the laptop in one of these things.

Laptopwallet

Laptopwallet is designed to hold the laptop really snug. The slim design keeps a laptop safe and enables you to carry it, either using the wrist-strap, in your hands or in a bag without being bulky. Currently sold out.

## Laptop Decoration: Sweeties and Cuties

Sometimes simple decoration isn't enough. In fact, you can not just put a skin on your laptop or engrave it, or even use some fancy sleeve to give it a new outfit. No, you can go far further, use spray paints, decals and feather boas. You can also simply get some sweet accessories for your old friend as well.

Monster Laptop Sleeve

"Handmade and available in four different colors, the case reminds us of a fanged cousin of cookie monster. Plus, it looks more like something that would hold a Fisher-Price computer, as opposed to a Sony or Apple — keeping would-be thieves guessing." Price: $65.

MacBook laptop sleeve

"I sewed my new Macbook a laptop sleeve! No pattern, just a zippered pouch. Starting fabric size 14.5" by 10.5". Fabrics are Denyse Schmidt quilting cotton, pink silk Dupioni for the lining, unknown cotton blend for the pocket, and wool felt (2 layers on each side) for the padding."

## Stickers

<strong>Stickers</strong> are always extremely subjective and that's why also very personal. If you'd like your laptop to reflect the unique personality of its owner, stickers might probably be the easiest way to go and therefore a first option to consider. Besides, often they are simply cool and it's a lot of fun to observe strangers reading them. You'll find many more stickers in the Laptop Stickers Flickr Pool.

Jedibook w/ Technorati sticker

Unfortunately, Smashing magazine isn't sticked here.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e0fabbb7-caaa-446b-a7e1-125ad0f231ed/laptop-32.jpg" alt="Laptop Designs - Jedibook w/ Technorati sticker" width="450" height="271" />

Powerbook stickers

In most cases stickers are pretty unusual; however, often personal music preferences are combined with the stickers of web-services the laptop owner uses.

Often stickers are messages the owners send to everybody who will have the luck (or misfortune) to meet the owner of the laptop.

## Experimental ideas (Don't try this at home!)

Datamancer's Steampunk Victorian Laptop

This may look like a Victorian music box, but inside this intricately hand-crafted wooden case lives a Hewlett-Packard ZT1000 laptop that runs both Windows XP and Ubuntu Linux. It features an elaborate display of clockworks under glass, engraved brass accents, claw feet, an antiqued copper keyboard and mouse, leather wrist pads, and customized wireless network card. The machine turns on with an antique clock-winding key by way of a custom-built ratcheting switch made from old clock parts. Video is included.
