What would you do if you were suddenly stranded on a desert island in the middle of nowhere, with only a USB drive, a dial-up internet connection, and a barebones computer with no software outside the operating system installed? Of course, you'd use the internet connection to call for help first, but what about after that? How would you keep your design business going?

Okay, maybe a scenario that's a bit more likely would work better. What if your computer crashed, wiping out all of your data and programs, and you have a deadline in two days? Or maybe you want to be able to pick up and leave at a moment's notice without taking anything more than a change of clothes and a USB drive. <strong>If you have the apps below, neither of those scenarios would be much of a problem</strong>.

The apps on this list can help you with everything from coding to graphics to running your business and managing your projects, all from a single USB drive. And while USB drives are getting bigger all the time (last I checked a 64GB one wasn't too badly priced, and that's 4GB more storage than my current MacBook has), you still need special programs in most instances to have true portability. The apps below are just that: truly portable and small enough to fit on a USB drive (often a very small USB drive).

One of Fotografix's biggest advantages, though, is it's tiny file size: it's only 367KB. If you want a really lightweight and easy to use graphics editor, Fotografix might be the right choice for you. However, it's not as robust as a program like Photoshop, so keep that in mind.</p>
