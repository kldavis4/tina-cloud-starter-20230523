### Behind The Design

As always, here are some insights from the designer:
<blockquote>"Pretty Pika! A new chunky pixel-perfect and vector-perfect icon style has been born. She loves tiny integration, looks gorgeous on Retina displays and covers all major themes. And (very) soon to be a semantic symbol font. We wouldn't want you to miss out and only hope you enjoy her as much as we do.

We are happy to provide designers and developers with an original and <em>crafted</em> icon design. Use visual language to make your graphic applications or identity design look sharp. "

<em>— Dutch Icon</em></blockquote>

Thanks, Dutch Icon! We sincerely appreciate your time and efforts!
