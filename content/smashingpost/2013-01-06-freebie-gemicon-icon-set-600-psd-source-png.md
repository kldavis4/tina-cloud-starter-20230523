## Behind The Design

As always, here is some insight from the designers themselves:
<blockquote>"Hello. Our names are Andy and Budi. We currently live in the “City of Heroes,” Surabaya, Indonesia.

Our motivation for creating Gemicon was to share with and contribute to the design community. It was around early November 2012 when we started to think of what the best way was that we could share with the community. At the time, we found that good-quality and free icon sets were still not being shared a lot, so we started sketching out icons on paper to begin the process.

We started with 50 to 60 icons, but we felt that wasn’t good enough for the community. Because we always want to finish any project as soon as possible but with a high quality at the same time, we were able to finish Gemicon in just three weeks.

We also tried to fit some unique icons into Gemicon with some of the food, beverage and transportation icons — the transportation icon was the most challenging one we created. When we were happy with the result, we started to share it on Dribbble and chose Christmas day to give it as a “gift” to the community that we love.

Feel free to get in touch with us on <a href="https://twitter.com/dturqois">Twitter</a> or Facebook, and see what we’re working on on Dribbble, or shoot us an <a href="mailto:dturqois@gmail.com">email</a>."</blockquote>

Thank you very much, Turqois! We really appreciate your effort.</p>
