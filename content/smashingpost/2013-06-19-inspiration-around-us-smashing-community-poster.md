<em>This is a metal movable type I acquired when I studied typography on Moholy–Nagy University of Art and Design. This small piece of the history of printing resides above my monitor in the peaceful company of a wooden letter “O” and a plastic “Q” key saved from a computer keyboard representing the ever changing tools of the written human culture. The actual background of the image shows a part of my CD collection wall.</em>

<em>This frog is a little paper clip. It has a small spring and can clasp papers in its mouth. It sits on my desk, and has ever since high school when my mother gave it to me. She got it as a child so I'm sure it's quite old. I should probably put it away and not use it but it's too cute and it makes me smile every time I look at it.</em>

<em>I was visiting one of my friend's relatives house. They have travelled around the world and the house contained lot of interesting pieces collected from other countries. The picture is of two tooth-picks' holder from Paris. They were really cute and I was playing around with them as if I was a kid. They were designed so as to hug each other when placed face to face. And when I looked at these two inanimate objects hugging so sweetly, I envisaged love, friendship, care ,solidarity, peace. I believe we were also designed so as to hug each other when placed face to face but some of the blue-prints got lost in translation. </em>

<em>Colours, rare lights make me inspired. They give me a strange, but very good feeling when ever I see such photos or real life scenes. It took me some time to get such bokehs, till I got an idea to use Christmas tree lights in the background! Those lights were exactly what I was looking for. When I was a little girl, I spent many hours near our tree and enjoying the lights and colours. Probably, that's why I get inspired when ever I see similar photos.</em>

<em>I've taken a picture of my old and dirty shoes I was obviously wearing way to often. But they are carrying so many reminders of every step I took, so they are a kind of inspiration. And actually I just like their worn out look.</em>
