### Behind the design

As always, here are some insights from the designer herself:
<blockquote>All of us designers need graphics and icons for our own sites, not just for client's sites, so we designed this icon set with that in mind. The set contains 12 big icons in 256x256 format. Both layered PSDs and transparent PNGs are included. We like to call it our 'designer portfolio icon set'. The set includes the following icons:
<ul>
 	<li>Avatar</li>
 	<li>Portfolio</li>
 	<li>Brushes</li>
 	<li>Mail / Envelope</li>
 	<li>Color Palette</li>
 	<li>Colored Pencils</li>
 	<li>Tablet</li>
 	<li>Laptop Computer</li>
 	<li>Moleskine Notebook</li>
 	<li>DSLR Camera</li>
 	<li>Easel With Canvas</li>
 	<li>Coffee Cup (who said designers drink too much coffee?)</li>
</ul>
