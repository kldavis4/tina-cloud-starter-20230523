**Cookie consent prompts**, push notifications, app install prompts, video autoplays and annoying pop-ups. Every time we enter a new site, it feels like a fight against all the annoying marketing messages endlessly streaming at us. If you’ve wondered why a product you looked up in a search engine one day keeps showing up in all your social channels over and over just a few hours later, that’s the power of data collection and retargeting at play. We can do better than that though.

For a few years now, we’ve been running live sessions with respected professionals on Smashing TV &mdash; our video channel for our dear <a href="/membership">Smashing Members</a>, who support our little team and our little adventures every month. As the webinars have always been about sharing lessons learned with the community, we’d like to open them up to everybody, with Members having a chance to ask questions right after the session.

The session took place on December 3 at 5:00 PM London time. In case the video below doesn’t play, you can also watch it directly on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCqNC2gYUfI).

In this session, Vitaly explores privacy UX patterns, techniques, strategies and important decisions to consider when designing and building privacy-aware websites and applcations.
