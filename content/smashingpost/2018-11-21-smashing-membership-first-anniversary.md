Doesn’t time fly? And don’t ships sail? A year ago, we launched our [Smashing Membership](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/membership) programme so that members of the Smashing readership could support us for a small amount of money (most people pay $5 or $9 a month, and can cancel at any time). In return get access to our ebooks, members-only webinars, discounts on printed books and conferences, and other benefits.

We did this because we wanted to reduce advertising on the site; ad revenues were declining, and the tech-savvy Smashing audience was becoming increasingly aware of the security and privacy implications of ads. And we were inspired by the example of _The Guardian_, a British newspaper that decided to keep its content outside a paywall but ask readers for support. Just last week, the Guardian’s editor-in-chief revealed that they have the [financal support of 1 million people](https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2018/nov/12/katharine-viner-guardian-million-reader-funding).

## Into Year Two

We recently welcomed [Bruce Lawson](https://www.brucelawson.co.uk/) to the team as our _Membership Commissioning Editor_. Bruce is well known for his work on accessibility and web standards, as well as his fashion blog and world-class jokes.

So now that the team is larger, we’ll be bringing you more content &mdash; going up to three webinars a month. The price stays the same. And, of course, we’d love your input on subjects or speakers &mdash; [let us know on Slack](https://smashing-membership.slack.com).

When we set up Membership, we promised that it would be an inclusive place where lesser-heard voices (in addition to big names) would be beamed straight to your living room/ home office/ sauna over Smashing TV. Next month, for example, Bruce is pleased to host a webinar by Eka, Jing, and Sophia from Indonesia, Singapore, and the Philippines to tell us about the [state of the web in South East Asia](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/smashing-tv/state-of-the-web-in-south-east-asia/). Perhaps you’d like to join us?

Please consider becoming a Smashing Member. Your support allows us to bring you great content, [pay all our contributors fairly](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/membership#how-we-spent-the-money), and reduce advertising on the site. 

Thank you so much to all who have helped to make it happen! We sincerely appreciate it.
