  Today designing a unique, compelling portfolio has become a crucial task for
  designers, studios, companies and everyone whose business is on the Web. Not
  only does it help one stand out among the numerous competitors, but it is also
  a great tool for self-expression and demonstration of skills.

  Now designers face new challenges in attracting the capricious web audience –
  a plain web page with a project list on it is out of date and boring, while
  fancy Flash websites with intricate navigation are annoying. Fortunately,
  despite all difficulties beautiful and artistic designs are appearing in an
  endless stream. Designers skillfully use all the benefits of the digital age
  and create websites that are rich in effects and eye-popping yet simple and
  accessible.

You may be confused with the navigation of this website at first, but you will quickly figure out how to get to the work gallery and the personal stuff of designer George Petrescu. This Flash-like motioned grid is developed by means of fancy jQuery.

A big fun in this one. No doubt, this cartoonish, childlike design took some really adult skills to be done.

This design is everything but ordinary. As the guys from IAAH say, this site is meant to challenge the concept of space and how it is perceived within the browser window. Experimental layout may frustrate the advocates of simplicity and usability standards, but if you enjoy approaches that push the boundaries of web design, portfolio site of Iamalwayshungry studio will appeal to you.

This portfolio design offers a wide range of various options – you can switch between several design themes, filter displayed portfolio categories and read the site both in English and Spanish. Great!

If grid layouts are classics of web design, this Japanese website is avant-garde, without fail.

The border between originality and weirdness is rather fuzzy here. Perhaps it will take us, Western culture representatives, a few years to understand the delicate philosophy of Japanese web design.
