### Behind The Design

As always, here are some insights from the designer:
<blockquote>"The first Version was released in February 2012 and had around 120 glyphs. Actually, the only reason why I designed it was that I myself needed a well-designed pictogram suite for my own projects. I also wanted a suite with a more illustrated style than the ones available out there. So I started with the 20-30 glyphs that I needed at the time — ending up with 120 glyphs. And since I already had done the work, it was an obvious choice to release them free to the Web design community we all are a part of. Let's say it was my chance to give something back.

So now — 7 months and 83.000 downloads later — it was time for an update. During that time, many people asked for new glyphs that they felt should be a part of the suite. This, together with my own ever-expanding need for pictograms, has led to <em>Entypo 2</em> with over 280 glyphs.

The update has brought:
<ul>
 	<li>Over 150 new glyphs</li>
 	<li>Improved design of many of the old icons</li>
 	<li>A new social media extension</li>
 	<li>Improved hinting</li>
</ul>
When selecting what social media services should go into the <em>Entypo Social</em>, it was important for me to include services from non-Western societies as well. That's why Entypo is the first suite where you can find pictograms for QQ, Renren, Sina Weibo, Mixi and VK. And true to the phrase "carefully crafted" I haven't just copy-pasted the logos of all services into the suite. I have actually redrawn most of them so they are optimized for a size of 20x20 pix at 72 dpi.

The hardest pictogram to draw was strangely enough the <strong>key</strong> glyph. It sounds pretty straightforward, but getting the perfect shape of a modern key that would go well with the rest of the suite took me quite some time.

My favorite pictogram is the <strong>trash can</strong>. It has a very distinct look to it and sets it apart from all other icon fonts. The trash can is also one of those pictograms that have depth. You might notice that Entypo is a mix of flat glyphs and ones with a bit of perspective.
