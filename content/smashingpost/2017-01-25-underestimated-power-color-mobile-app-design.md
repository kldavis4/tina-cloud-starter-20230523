  Color is arguably the second most important aspect of your app, after
  functionality. The human to computer interaction is heavily based on
  interacting with graphical UI elements, and color plays a critical role in
  this interaction.

  It helps users see and interpret your app's content, interact with the correct
  elements, and understand actions. **Every app has a color scheme**, and it
  uses the primary colors for its main areas.

When designing a new app, it's often difficult to decide on a color scheme that works well, as there are an infinite number of possible color combinations out there. In this article, we'll go over the most important points related to color in apps. We'll cover traditional color scheme patterns (monochrome, analogous, complementary), custom color combinations that aren't based strictly on any one pattern, and we'll also learn how to choose colors and contrasts for your app that support usability. If you'd like to hone your own color usage skills, you can download and test [Adobe XD](https://adobe.ly/2iHmxQr) **for free**, and get started right away.</p>

## How To Select An Effective Color Scheme

When creating a color scheme there are many factors to consider, including brand colors and color associations for your region.

### **How Many Colors?**

Keeping your color combinations simple will help you improve the [user experience](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/10/what-is-user-experience-design-overview-tools-and-resources/). A simple color scheme isn't overwhelming to the eye and makes your content easier to understand. Conversely, having too many colors in too many places is an easy way to mess up a design.

A [University of Toronto study](https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~donovan/color/colorcomp.pdf) on how people used [Adobe Color CC](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/) revealed that most people _preferred_ simple color combinations that relied on only two to three colors.</p>

### **How To Create a Scheme**

So, how do you choose those two or three colors? The color wheel can help.</p>

There are a number of predefined color scheme standards that make creating new schemes easier, especially for beginners.</p>

### **Monochromatic**

Monochromatic schemes are the simplest color schemes to create, as each color is taken from the same base color. Monochromatic colors go well together, producing a soothing effect.</p>

<figure><a href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/23aae260-599f-44fb-87cc-5587c2bae13d/2-large-opt.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/b5ce3296-0109-40bb-b0b5-ecfcc5ed8ee7/2-preview-opt-1.png" /></a><figcaption>Monochromatic colors are a single color, and its tints, shades, and tones.

The monochromatic scheme is very easy on the eyes, especially with blue or green hues.</p>

<figure><a href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a001cdad-85cc-4233-aea5-4f9fce0c04af/3-large-opt.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2877c7dc-212c-49fe-98ff-04913aba225a/3-preview-opt.png" /></a><figcaption>Image credit: <a href="https://color.adobe.com/">Adobe Color CC</a>.

<figure><a href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c89ac9e2-6881-4de2-be97-d613268fff2e/4-preview-opt.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c89ac9e2-6881-4de2-be97-d613268fff2e/4-preview-opt.jpg" /></a><figcaption>Image credit: <a href="https://twitter.com/louis_saville">Louis Saville</a></figcaption></figure>

As you can see, the scheme looks clean and elegant.</p>

### **Analogous**

Analogous color schemes are created from related colors that don't stand out from one another; one color is used as a dominant color while others are used to enrich the scheme.</p>

<figure><a href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f10699b4-c926-4d8d-8990-3455e44caa85/5-large-opt.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c266ea86-ecf8-41c3-981c-bc89075abd02/5-preview-opt-1.png" /></a><figcaption>Analogous schemes are created by using three colors that are next to each other on the 12-spoke color wheel. (<a href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f10699b4-c926-4d8d-8990-3455e44caa85/5-large-opt.png">Large preview</a>)</figcaption></figure>

While this scheme is relatively easy to pull off, the trick is in deciding which vibrancy of color to use, as it will be exaggerated. For example, [Clear](https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/clear-tasks-reminders-to-do/id493136154?mt=8), a [gesture-driven](https://blogs.adobe.com/creativecloud/in-app-gestures-and-mobile-app-user-experience/) to-do app, uses the analogous colors to visually prioritize current set of tasks.</p>

While [Calm](https://www.calm.com/), a meditation app, uses the analogous colors blue and green to help users feel relaxed and peaceful.</p>

### **Complementary**

Colors aren't always at odds with each other; complementary colors are opposite colors.</p>

<figure><a href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a037aa6e-4302-4e09-a6b5-5727e861f3a7/10-large-opt.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/671ce859-7ff5-4056-956b-7d5f2e1c2279/10-preview-opt.png" /></a><figcaption>Complementary colors are opposite of each other on the color wheel. (<a href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a037aa6e-4302-4e09-a6b5-5727e861f3a7/10-large-opt.png">Large preview</a>)</figcaption></figure>

They contrast strongly, and they can be used to attract the viewer's attention. When using a complementary scheme, it is important to choose a dominant color and use its complementary color for accents. For example, when the human eye sees an object full of different hues of greens, a _bit_ of red is going to stand out very well.</p>

<figure><a href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d619f73c-8cdf-4cb7-8165-40a0f59059ca/11-preview-opt.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d619f73c-8cdf-4cb7-8165-40a0f59059ca/11-preview-opt.png" /></a><figcaption>Using complementary colors is the easiest way to make something to stand out.</figcaption></figure>

However, you have to use complementary colors carefully to keep your content from being visually jarring.</p>

### **Custom Color Scheme**

Creating your own color schemes is not as complicated as many people think. Adding a bright accent color into an otherwise neutral palette is one of the easiest color schemes to create, and it's also one of the most visually striking.</p>

### Adobe Color CC Makes Your Life Easier

Adobe [Color CC](https://color.adobe.com/), previously known as Kuler, makes color selection extremely easy. Every color on the palette can be individually modified or chosen as the base color with a few simple clicks.</p>

## The Impact Of Color Contrast

Typically, a colored object or area on a UI is not displayed in isolation, but is adjacent to or superimposed on another colored object or area. This creates contrast effects. Contrast is how one color stands apart from another. Properly used, it reduces eyestrain and focuses user attention by clearly dividing elements on a screen.</p>

<figure><a href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/b79f2773-51c7-4a4e-b169-e3164fa48ff2/17-large-opt-1.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/cf2cfb2c-1e54-4063-b715-867386433ea3/17-preview-opt-1.png" /></a><figcaption>High contrast is when colors easily stand apart from each other.

### **Contrast and Text Readability**

Color contrast is one area where color theory is crucial to the usability of a design. Designers often like to use low contrast techniques because low contrast makes things look beautiful and harmonious. However, beautiful isn't always the best for readability. When you're using colors in text, be aware that placing two colors with low-value contrast next to each other can make your copy very difficult to read. This is especially true on mobile screens, where users are often on devices outdoors or in bright places that cause screen glare.</p>

<figure><a href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f9d28a9f-2a20-4de6-9f43-f1b503b31b29/18-preview-opt.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f9d28a9f-2a20-4de6-9f43-f1b503b31b29/18-preview-opt.jpg" /></a><figcaption>These lines of text are difficult to read against their background colors.</figcaption></figure>

Make sure you have a fair amount of contrast between elements. It's really not that hard — all you need to do is to check the _contrast ratio_. Contrast ratios represent how different a color is from another color (commonly written as 1:1 or 21:1). The higher the difference between the two numbers in the ratio, the greater the difference in relative luminance between the colors. The [W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html) [recommends](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html) the following contrast ratios for body text and image text:

*   Small text should have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against its background.
*   Large text (at 14 pt bold/18 pt regular and up) should have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against its background.

This guideline also helps users with low vision, color blindness, or worsening vision see and read the text on your screen.</p>

Icons or other critical elements should also use the above-recommended contrast ratios.</p>

There are several free tools available to give you meaningful feedback about the levels of contrast in your chosen palette. One of them is [WebAIM's Color Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) which let you test colors you have already chosen.</p>

### Contrast and User's Attention

Along with establishing readable text, contrast can also draw the user's attention towards specific elements on a screen. Generally, high-contrast is the best choice for important content or key elements. So, if you want users to see or click something, make it stand out! For example, users are much more likely to click a call-to-action button that strongly contrasts with its background.</p>

## Designing For Color Blindness

Have you thought about your app appears to users who have visual impairments?

When people talk about [color blindness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness#Dichromacy), they usually refer to the inability of perceiving certain colors. Approximately 8% of men and 0.5% of women are affected by some form of color blindness. Red and green colors are a common problematic combination.</p>

Since colorblindness takes different forms (including red-green, blue-yellow, and monochromatic), it's important to use multiple visual cues to communicate important states in your app. Never rely on a color solely to indicates system status. Instead, use elements such as strokes, indicators, patterns, texture, or text to describe actions and content.</p>

Also, [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/accessibility/products/photoshop.html) has really useful tools to help, and can simulate color blindness. This feature allows the designer to see what the app's screen will look like to people with different types of color blindness.</p>
