We express sincere gratitude to Oliver for his truly amazing work. Please let us know in the comments if this release meets your expectations. And if not, please let us know what we could improve in the upcoming releases!

### Motivation behind the design

As usual, here are some insights from the designer himself:
<blockquote>After releasing my first pixel-based iconset 'flavour' right here at Smashing magazine, the feedback of the readers was incredible! I received tons of emails, awesome critics and plenty of suggestions for the sequel. Back then I wrote that I wanted to create and publish a second version. So I took a little time out of icon design to get my mind clear and then started to work on the &lt;&lt;extended&gt;&gt;-package. With the ideas in my head and the great suggestions I got from you, designing Flavour &lt;&lt;extended&gt;&gt; was a blast and so much fun for me. Finally I came up with 270 new icons – many more than I would have expected initially. And I hope you like them all and use them in your web-projects.

As last time, all icons are 100% free to use for both private and commercial projects and all the .psd-sources are available to download as well. Please feel free to learn from them and make them fit your personal needs if they don't do yet.

Have fun with the package and please feel free to support me with more feedback in the comments, via email at icons [at] addictedtocoffee.de or <a href="https://twitter.com/mywayhome">on Twitter</a>! Together we can even create a third part if you like one to be released!

Best wishes from Bonn, Germany,

Oliver</blockquote>
