<a href="https://yizzle.com/whatthehex/">What the Hex?</a>
Among the variety of methods of representing color values, some are easier to identify than others. The hexadecimal system, though, often looks incomprehensible. If you feel you know colors pretty well, then this is a simple game for you. All you have to do is match the hexadecimal code (which is actually a group of three hex numbers: #<span style="color: red">rr</span><span style="color: green">gg</span><span style="color: blue">bb</span>) with the corresponding color. Of course, this is easier said than done, but you can adjust the difficulty by displaying between 2 and 48 possible answers.
