### Motivation behind the design

As usual, here are some insights from the designer:
<blockquote>With the help of the „Mister Acorn” icon set I’ve managed to bring a piece of nature to life. It’s about a set composed of vectorial cartoon style icons, in witch the main caracter, mister acorn is shown in diferent situations. You can see the set as a voyage of the main caracter through the world, from Italy, the magical world of cartoons, to France.

At the same time, the icons are adapted to webdesign necessities containing specific elements. It’s a free to use icon set for non-commercial purpose released in png and ai formats.

So, if you thought that acorns don’t have a soul, well think again!

Best wishes, The Creator, Monica Corduneanu from <a href="https://creaturesland.com">Creatures Land</a>.</blockquote>
