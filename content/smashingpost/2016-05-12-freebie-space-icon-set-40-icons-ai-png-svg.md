  We've featured a lot of different icon sets in the past, but we still haven't
  had one dedicated to rockets, satellites and solar systems (well, don't forget
  supernatural aliens as well). **There's so much to explore in the world of
  astronomy**, and it's about time we did. Today's icon set was created and
  designed by the team at _Iconshock_, and consists of 40 icons in AI, PNG as
  well as SVG formats. So, dear space troopers out there, what are you waiting
  for?

  Please note that this icon set is licensed under a Creative Commons
  Attribution 3.0 Unported. You may modify the size, color or shape of the
  icons. No attribution is required, however, reselling of bundles or individual
  pictograms is not cool. Please provide credits to the creators and link to the
  article in which this freebie was released if you would like to spread the
  word in blog posts or anywhere else.

### Insights From The Designers

<blockquote>"Our team is truly motivated by the human incursion in outer space and the constant seeking of life and other solar systems in near galaxies. New technologies are coming across in terms of interstellar travel; little spacecrafts as electronic chips, fueled by a giant laser on earth through solar veils are thought to be built and launched in a near future to explore solar systems located in the Milky Way neighborhood. Topics like these inspire our team!

These are subjects of huge importance for humankind in general and for us in particular when we decided to launch this cool icon pack filled with emotion and design related to this matter. They were inspired by our <a href="https://www.iconshock.com/line-icon/">Color Line Icon Set</a> and we're thrilled to present this set with 40 icons including vector files in AI and SVG formats featuring nice and good-looking colors and, of course, a space-like atmosphere."</blockquote>

A big thank you to Juan Pablo Sarmiento — we sincerely appreciate your time and efforts. Keep up the brilliant work!
