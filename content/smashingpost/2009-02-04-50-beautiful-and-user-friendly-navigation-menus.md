  Usability is an essential goal of any website, and usable navigation is
  something every website needs. It determines where users are led and how they
  interact with the website. Without usable navigation, content becomes all but
  useless. Menus need to be simple enough for the user to understand, but also
  contain the elements necessary to guide the user through the website — with
  some creativity and good design thrown in.

## [Planning And Implementing Website Navigation](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/06/06/planning-and-implementing-website-navigation/ "Permanent Link to Planning And Implementing Website Navigation")

The thing that makes navigation difficult to work with in Web design is that it can be so versatile. Navigation can be simple or complex: a few main pages or a multi-level architecture; one set of content for logged-in users and another for logged-out users; and so on. Because navigation can vary so much between websites, there are no set guidelines or how-to's for organizing navigation.

<figure><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/06/06/planning-and-implementing-website-navigation/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c4855393-52a4-4635-8ea2-7448b8420735/new-strategy-screenshot1.jpg" alt="New Strategy" width="502" height="336" /></a></figure>

Designing navigation is an art in itself, and designers become better at it with experience. It's all about using good information architecture: "the art of expressing a model or concept of information used in activities that require explicit details of complex systems."

## [Showcase of Creative Navigation Menus: Good and Bad Examples](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/04/19/showcase-of-creative-navigation-menus-good-and-bad-examples/ "Permanent Link to Showcase of Creative Navigation Menus: Good and Bad Examples")

Good navigation is the main cornerstone of an effective website. In practice, however, it's often a tough challenge to come up with a meaningful, unambiguous way to organize, arrange, and display content to users; and it's often not much easier to find a visually interesting solution either. The wide adaption of JavaScript libraries like jQuery is making it increasingly easy to add various kinds of sleek animations to navigation design.

<figure><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/04/19/showcase-of-creative-navigation-menus-good-and-bad-examples/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/3d4bf84b-56aa-49ac-9990-857432b4cba0/bluecadet.jpg" alt="Design Intellection" width="500" height="324" /></a></figure>

For instance, many recent promo websites are essentially single page websites with an array of animation effects used to make navigation a smoother and richer user experience. We need to be very careful and cautious when using these dynamic effects in our designs. A simple, calm navigation is usually much more user-friendly than an evolved, dynamic one. Users want to use the website, not be baffled by the weird and hardly usable navigation. But that's not to say that a creative navigation should be avoided at all costs.

## [Showcase of Interesting Navigation Designs](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/09/07/showcase-of-interesting-navigation-designs/ "Permanent Link to Showcase of Interesting Navigation Designs")

Everyone is always looking for interesting and effective ways to organize their website and allow users to move about and find things. But there's a fine line between unexpected and unusable. Three points to consider in any navigation scheme are consistency, user expectations and contextual clues.

<figure><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/09/07/showcase-of-interesting-navigation-designs/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/42f7a0c1-fe0d-408d-91d4-5d845f9f381c/beauty1.jpg" alt="Foundation Six Portfolio" width="500" height="393" /></a></figure>

If page is long and provides different levels of <strong>navigation</strong>, will users be able to find their way through the site and use proper navigation quickly? Forcing visitors to use certain keystrokes to navigate, rather than what they're used to, might be novel, but is that effective if you have to explain instructions prominently on your home page? Here are some examples for your reading pleasure.

## [Showcase Of Beautiful Vertical Navigation Designs](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/04/19/showcase-of-beautiful-vertical-navigation-designs/ "Permanent Link to Showcase Of Beautiful Vertical Navigation Designs")

Go to any website and you're guaranteed to find one thing: a <strong>navigation menu</strong>. Navigation menus enable visitors to move from page to page; without them, we would have no way to conveniently explore websites. Perhaps this is why designers, information architects, usability researchers and user experience specialists invest so much time and resources into devising aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly navigation systems.

<figure><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/04/19/showcase-of-beautiful-vertical-navigation-designs/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/78646427-5f69-4000-92fe-c461b839b370/garys-real-life.jpg" alt="gary's real life" width="467" height="564" /></a></figure>

Website navigation menus generally come in one of two orientations: vertical and horizontal. Horizontal navigation menus display items side by side. Vertical navigation menus stack items on top of each other. In this post, we highlight some <strong>remarkable vertical navigation menus</strong>, for your inspiration.

## [Showcase Of Modern Navigation Design Trends](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/01/04/showcase-of-modern-navigation-design-trends/ "Permanent Link to Showcase Of Modern Navigation Design Trends")

The <strong>navigation menu</strong> is perhaps a website's single most important component. Navigation gives you a window onto the website designer's creative ability to produce a functional yet visually impressive element that's fundamental to most websites. Because of their value to websites, navigation menus are customarily placed in the most visible location of the page, and thus can make a significant impact on the visitor's first impression.

<figure><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/01/04/showcase-of-modern-navigation-design-trends/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/1c4010cb-875e-406d-81a2-1f1a3de3caf1/delibar-navigation.jpg" alt="Delibar" width="500" height="243" /></a></figure>

The design of a navigation menu has to be outstanding in order to sustain the user's interest. As the adage goes, "Content is king," but getting to the content requires navigation. In this post, we'll be explore some of the more <strong>recent trends in navigation design</strong>. We'll look at the aesthetics that recur in today's best Web designs. The focus here is on the visual direction that leading designers are taking.

## [Horizontal Navigation Menus: Trends, Patterns, and Best Practices](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/09/07/horizontal-navigation-menus-trends-patterns-and-best-practices/ "Permanent Link to Horizontal Navigation Menus: Trends, Patterns, and Best Practices")

The horizontal navigation menu has become a mainstay in Web design. It is safe to say that nowadays most websites use some form of <strong>horizontal navigation to facilitate content browsing</strong>. The dominance of horizontal navigation over vertical (i.e. down a sidebar) is obviously due to the design and content limitations of the latter. Notably, <a href="https://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2006/04/26/horizontal-navigation/">CNN discovered those limitations</a> before switching from vertical to horizontal a few years back.

<figure><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/09/07/horizontal-navigation-menus-trends-patterns-and-best-practices/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f6b07f9c-fe3f-4986-8b02-0c2706e28355/impulse-nav.jpg" alt="ImpulseNav Screenshot" width="500" height="314" /></a></figure>

There are, however, many styles of horizontal navigation in modern Web design. Some offer usability advantages for certain types of websites, while others are aesthetically better. In this article, we will focus on a variety of <strong>techniques and best practices to improve the usability of horizontal navigation bars</strong>, and we will note less effective styles. We'll also look at several trends that developers can choose from when working on the navigation design for their next project.

## [Showcase Of Well-Designed Tabbed Navigation](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/06/showcase-of-well-designed-tabbed-navigation/ "Permanent Link to Showcase Of Well-Designed Tabbed Navigation")

There are an extensive amount of roads you can take in web design, specifically in navigation. Here, we will talk about one specific navigation technique, tab-based navigation. If properly carried out, tabbed navigation can be very clean and organized within a web layout.

So <strong>what is tabbed navigation</strong>? Well, it is essentially a set of buttons most often set horizontally. Tabs generally follow numerous different styling guidelines. First, a tab set usually is attached to or slightly protrudes from a container, like in the example below. Also, notice how the open tab matches the background color of the container, and the other buttons are darker. This is another common styling guideline.

<figure><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/06/showcase-of-well-designed-tabbed-navigation/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/38b7fcc6-a43d-4616-88e9-093978b4c964/iceberg.jpg" alt="Screenshot" /></a></figure>

When you look at tabbed navigations, you will also notice many styling trends. First, many tabs will have rounded corners on buttons. This helps to create a clean look. Also helping to make a clean look is the use of separation between buttons. Most designs use space to separate buttons, but a bevel, single line, or background color contrast will also look nicely.

## [Designing Drop-Down Menus: Examples and Best Practices](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/03/24/designing-drop-down-menus-examples-and-best-practices/ "Permanent Link to Designing Drop-Down Menus: Examples and Best Practices")

As a general rule, most Web developers, especially usability enthusiasts, say it is bad practice to use <strong>drop-down menus</strong> because they are confusing, annoying and oftentimes dysfunctional. From a design standpoint, however, drop-down menus are an excellent feature because they help clean up a busy layout. If structured correctly, drop-down menus can be a great navigation tool, while still being a usable and attractive design feature.

Yes, that's right: drop-down navigation menus can be user-friendly. Just yesterday Jacob Nielsen the results of his recent <a href="https://www.useit.com/alertbox/mega-dropdown-menus.html">drop-down menus study</a>, in which he found out that big, two-dimensional drop-down panels that group navigation options help users to avoid scrolling and can precisely explain the user's choices with effective use of typography, icons, and tooltips.

<figure><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/03/24/designing-drop-down-menus-examples-and-best-practices/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/49f1202c-ad2e-489a-83d8-25276ad24540/macstorm.gif" alt="Screenshot" width="450" height="350" /></a></figure>

In this article we take a closer look at the nature of <strong>drop-down navigation menus</strong>, analyze situations in which they should or should not be used, discuss various implementations and finally showcase a couple of bad and good examples of such menus. The article also includes various tips and suggestions to help you work with your drop-down menus.

## [Navigation Menus: Trends and Examples](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/02/26/navigation-menus-trends-and-examples/ "Permanent Link to Navigation Menus: Trends and Examples")

<strong>Navigation is the most significant element in web design.</strong> Since web-layouts don't have any physical representation a user can stick to, consistent navigation menu is one of the few design elements which provide users with some sense of orientation and guide them through the site. Users should be able to rely on it which is why designers shouldn't mess around with it.

That's why in most cases it's where simple, intuitive and conventional solutions are usually the best option. However, it doesn't mean that they need to be boring. One year ago we've presented <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/03/14/css-based-navigation-menus-modern-solutions/">modern approaches of navigation design</a>. Let's take a look at what's different now, which trends one can observe and what ideas you can develop further in your projects.

<figure><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/02/26/navigation-menus-trends-and-examples/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/b62919cb-3ca3-4b75-831f-ff0d9bca3bb0/school-1.png" alt="Screenshot" width="500" height="445" /></a></figure>

## [Can User Experience Be Beautiful? An Analysis Of Navigation In Portfolio Websites](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/03/26/an-analysis-navigation-portfolio-websites/ "Permanent Link to Can User Experience Be Beautiful? An Analysis Of Navigation In Portfolio Websites")

When users land on your website, they typically read the content available. Then, the next thing that they will do is to try and familiarize themselves with your website. Most of the time this involves looking for navigation.

<figure><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/03/26/an-analysis-navigation-portfolio-websites/"><img title="Portfolio Navigation Main Image" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0f1ae4d6-b1f2-493e-8450-b4d2efbae57b/portfolio-navigation-main-image.jpg" alt="Portfolio Navigation Main Image" /></a></figure>

In this article, I’ll be analyzing the navigation elements of a particular category of websites, i.e. <strong>portfolios</strong>. Why portfolios, you ask? Because they represent an interesting blend of creativity and development techniques. As they offer an intriguing user interface and interaction, this often borderlines with what is ultimately defined as an enjoyable user experience. Should aesthetics, originality and creativity come at the expense of usability? Can they reside on the same website in harmony?

## Navigation Menus Showcase

Below we present over 50 excellent navigation menus — we feature CSS-based design solutions, CSS+JavaScript-based menus and Flash-designs. However, they all have something in common: they are user-friendly yet creative and perfectly fit to the style of their respective websites.

A colorful menu that adds to the feel of the website.

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ad8e0e4e-f19d-4cd3-a6f6-e06c0d21b623/loodo.jpg" alt="Screenshot" /></figure>

Steven Wittens takes a look at the navigation menu from a quite unusual perspective.

Web Design Ledger has an excellent menu; its large size is convenient but doesn’t intrude on the content.

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/5707c3f9-df90-4795-b9e6-cae160c350ff/wdledger.jpg" alt="Screenshot" /></figure>

UX Booth uses a a stylish text box under the navigation as a sort of subtext for each menu item.

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/055cb217-dc0c-4b10-b862-766e349a8547/ux.jpg" alt="Screenshot" /></figure>

Vertical navigation menus are used very rarely, for the simple reason: they are harder to use. However, some designers risk unusual approaches. Nopoko Graphics uses an arrow and a hover-effect for its vertical navigation menu.

![Screenshot](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/6ffdef85-35b9-4f55-bda3-a53c29a00d20/nopoko.jpg)

This website uses a large image-based menu on the home page. The user’s attention is drawn directly to this large menu, making it convenient for users.

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d5f0eed5-2521-44c2-9bb3-2961e90edef2/icondesigner.jpg" alt="Screenshot" /></figure>

This large and colorful menu is very noticeable and uses a slight hover effect to further define the menu items.

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e407a51d-7ba3-42df-8a3c-a48e4b929152/cosmicsoda.jpg" alt="Screenshot" /></figure>

An intuitive drop-down navigation that uses 2 colors effectively to communicate the active navigation item and the passive ones.

A U.S. record label, presents its navigation menu in the form of a the so-called <em>Space Echo</em> Roland SE-201.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/1ab8b67a-88c1-410c-81f6-71665ff2613e/small.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="480" height="208" />

It's pretty hard to find a nice-looking drop-down menu. This one is a beautiful exception.

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d6a51130-c836-480d-ad5f-be2670fbaa56/ten.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="480" height="184" /></figure>

A really unusual navigation menu that uses some kind of a mindmap to illustrate the navigation. And, apart from that, the navigation menu is hand-drawn!

![Screenshot](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/061bf192-392b-4ad7-9ee0-7f7c6dbe1d64/rack.jpg)

A subtle yet distinct menu that is out of the way of content. Excellent colors and a nice hover effect also add to the menu.

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/bb5127a9-9e76-4b49-b6d1-3c2c232cb5df/culturedcodenav.jpg" alt="Screenshot" /></figure>

This menu has a clean and smooth layout, and it has a great sub-menu that uses transparency to separate it from the main menu.

This menu is located close to the content, where it is easy to use. It uses large icons, which adds a visual element to the navigation. Also, the menu on other pages uses the same icons in a vertical layout, bringing consistency to the website. The icons may not fit perfectly, but it's a nice idea.

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/249ad540-d350-4871-9a57-b71cbde36e43/duartepires.jpg" alt="Screenshot" /></figure>

Designers sometimes use tooltips for their navigation. However, tooltips and aqua are quite an unusual combination.

A perfect example of how one should organize huge amounts of content into clear and easily distinguishable sections. Also, excellent design of the drop-down menu.

Most entertainment websites use Flash and unusual navigation menus to capture users' attention. On this one, an instant classic, navigation items are put on cards.

This Argentinian design agency puts CDs and books on a table, each representing a navigation option, of course. When hovered over with a mouse, each object reveals what can be found inside.

The designers of this Flash-based site came up with something truly original. The navigation menu is put on a ribbon; each navigation item has a nice and simple hover-effect: when an icon is hovered, it is replaced with the site area the icon stands for. Usually tooltips are used for this puprose, here designers use a different approach. Outstanding!
