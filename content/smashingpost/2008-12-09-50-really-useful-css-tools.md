<strong>We love useful stuff</strong>. For months, we have been bookmarking interesting, useful and creative CSS tools and related resources. We have been contacting developers, encouraging them to improve their tools and release their handy little apps to the public. Last year we prepared and published some of them in a series of smashing posts about CSS. Now again is the time to give these tools the attention they deserve. Big thanks to all designers and developers who contributed to the design community over the last months and years. We — our community and the design community — truly appreciate your efforts.

Below, we present <strong>50 extremely useful CSS tools, generators, templates and resources</strong>. We did not include “traditional” CSS tools, such as <a href="https://getfirebug.com/" rel="nofollow">Firebug</a> or the <a href="https://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/" rel="nofollow">Web Developer extension</a>, but tried to focus on rather unknown tools that are definitely worth a look. Some tools are new and some are old, but hopefully everybody will find a couple of new useful or at least inspiring tools. <em>
</em>
