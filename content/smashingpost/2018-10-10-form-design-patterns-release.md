Forms. It's no coincidence that the word rhymes with “yawns” — web forms are dull to code and even duller for your visitors to fill in. But without forms, the web would just be a library. They let us comment, collect, book, buy, share, and a host of other verbs. And mostly they enable us to do these things in an awkward, opaque, confusing, odd, frustrating, alarming, or alienating way. Forms are such an important part of the web, but we design them poorly all the time. When they're not over-engineered they're usually not engineered at all.

With the new *Form Design Patterns* book we want to tackle this problem. By going through common real-world problems step by step, you’ll learn how to design simple, **robust**, **lightweight**, responsive, **accessible**, **progressively enhanced**, interoperable and intuitive forms that let users get stuff done no matter what. And by the end of the book you’ll have a close-to exhaustive list of components delivered as a design system that you can use immediately in your own projects. ([Jump to table of contents.](#toc))

## About The Book

*Form Design Patterns* contains ten chapters ([&#8595; Table of Contents](#toc)). Each one represents a common real-world problem that we’ll solve together step by step. Design is just as much about asking (and understanding) questions, as it is about creating solutions. So we’ll spend time doing just that: discussing the problem, weighing up the options, and **creating technical solutions that are simple and inclusive**. 

Ultimately, the book is about <strong>understanding what users need</strong>. Users are people and people are different. So we’ll be considering multiple interaction modalities and how to help users work under situational (temporary or permanent) and environmental circumstances. We’ll be looking at every problem through an inclusive design lens. Because good design is inclusive.

## Table Of Contents

Each chapter revolves around a specific problem — after all, that’s how we solve problems in real life. But don’t be concerned, many of the styles, **components** and **patterns** born out of each chapter are **reusable** and applicable well beyond the specifics and you’ll see examples of this as we move through the book.

1. **A Registration Form**  
We’ll start looking at the foundational qualities of a well-designed form and how to think about them. By applying something called a question protocol, we’ll look at how to _reduce friction_ without even touching the interface. Then we’ll look at some crucial patterns, including validation, that we’ll want to use for every form.
2. **A Checkout Form**  
We’ll consider checkout flows and look at several _input types_ and how they affect the user experience on mobile and desktop browsers, all the while looking at ways to help both first-time and returning customers order quickly and simply.
3. **A Flight Booking Form**  
We’ll dive into the world of _progressively enhanced_, custom form components using ARIA. We’ll do this by exploring the best way to let users select destinations, pick dates, add passengers, and choose seats. We’ll analyze _native form controls_, and look at breaking away from convention when it becomes necessary.
4. **A Login Form**  
We’ll look at the ubiquitous login form. Despite its simple appearance, there’s a bunch of usability failures that so many sites suffer from.
5. **An Inbox**  
We’ll design ways to manage email in bulk, our first look at administrative interfaces. As such, this comes with its own set of challenges and patterns, including a responsive ARIA-described action menu, _multiple selection_, and _same-page messaging_.
6. **A Search Form**  
We’ll create a responsive search form that is readily available to users on all pages, and we’ll also consider the importance of the search mechanism that powers it. 
7. **A Filter Form**  
Users often need to filter a large set of unwieldy search results. Without a well-designed filter, users are bound to give up. Filters pose a number of interesting and unique design problems that may force us to challenge best practice to give users a better experience.
8. **An Upload Form**  
Many services, like photo sharing, messaging, and many back-office applications, let users upload images and documents. We’ll study the file input and how we can use it to upload multiple files at once. Then we’ll look at the intricacies of a drag-and-drop, Ajax-enhanced interface that is inclusive of keyboard and screen reader users.
9. **An Expense Form**  
We’ll investigate the special problem of needing to create and add lots of expenses (or anything else) into a system. This is really an excuse to cover the _add another pattern_, which is often useful in administrative interfaces.
10. **A Really Long and Complicated Form**  
Some forms are very long and take hours to complete. We’ll look at some of the patterns we can use to make long forms easier to manage.

## Testimonials

It has been our goal to make the book **as practical and useful as possible**. We’ve been honored to receive very positive reviews from people making websites on small and large scale.

- “I have been writing forms in HTML for over 20 years. This book captures the essence of what it is to embrace standards, progressively enhance and deliver **simple, accessible forms**. By formalising design patterns we can all use and implement, developers and designers can focus on their website and product. I wish this was available 20 years ago!”  
*&mdash; Paul Duncan, Design Technologists and Accessibility Teacher*
- “In a world of horribly marked up forms, this book is a beacon of light illuminating the way to more accessible user experiences. I highly recommend it to anyone designing or developing user interfaces to avoid the common form accessibility pitfalls we see all too often.”  
*&mdash; Marcy Sutton, Accessibility Advocate*
- “Forms. It's no coincidence that the word rhymes with "yawns" - forms are dull to code and even duller for your visitors to fill in. So make them work better for everyone, using the concrete tips, code and microcopy in this book. And take away your own yawns, as Adam Silver has done all the research and coding for you.”  
*&mdash; Bruce Lawson, Web standards Advocate*
- “Form Design Patterns is setting out common sense and **inclusive solutions for forms** both simple and potentially complex. It's your companion as you strive to create a simpler and easier interactive web.”  
*&mdash; Heydon Pickering, UX and accessibility consultant*
