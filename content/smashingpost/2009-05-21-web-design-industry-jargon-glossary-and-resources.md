There are specialized web terms referring to all sorts of aspects of <a title="10 Principles Of Effective Web Design" href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/01/10-principles-of-effective-web-design/">web design</a>. For someone just getting started in web design, or someone looking to have a site designed, all the technical jargon can be overwhelming. Especially the acronyms.

Below is a guide to industry terms that <strong>should get you well on your way to understanding what web designers are talking about</strong>. In addition, we've provided some resources for each term to give you more in-depth information.</p>

## A

### Accessibility

Basically, this is the ability of a website to be used by people with disabilities, including visually impaired visitors using screen readers, hearing impaired visitors using no sound, color blind people, or those with other disabilities. A website with low accessibility is basically going to be impossible for those with disabilities to use. Accessibility is particularly important for sites providing information to those with disabilities (healthcare sites, government sites, etc.), though it is an important aspect to consider when designing any site.

### AJAX

Stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. AJAX is typically used for creating dynamic web applications and allows for asynchronous data retrieval without having to reload the page a visitor is on. The JavaScript on a given page handles most of the basic functions of the application, making it perform more like a desktop program instead of a web-based one.

<figure><a href="#"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async"  class="alignnone" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/07c8aded-f0fa-4d4f-8d91-9497e970e66d/ajax.jpg" alt="Glossary and Resources" width="480" height="300" /></a></figure>

### Anchor Text

The text a link uses to refer to your site. This can make a big difference in your site's search engine results. See also: Backlink.

### Automagically

A portmanteau that combines "automatically" and "magically." Generally, it refers to something that has a complex technical process that's hidden from users, so that something almost appears to work by magic. If you think about it, many modern internet-based technologies could be classified as "automagical."

<figure><a href="#"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async"  src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/92271009-e5e6-4b1f-9f0b-30fe9e695bd7/automagical.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="480" height="360" /></a></figure>

## B

### Back End

The back end of a website is the part hidden from view of regular website visitors. The back end generally includes the information structure, applications, and the CMS controlling content on the site.

*   [Building the Back-End of a Photo Site](https://code.tutsplus.com/articles/building-the-back-end-of-a-photo-site--net-1942) from Nettuts+

### Backlink

Backlinks are links from other sites back to your own. They're sometimes also referred to as "trackbacks" (especially on blogs). Backlinks have a huge impact on your sites search rankings. Lots of backlinks from high-ranking sites can greatly improve your search engine results, especially if those links use keywords in their anchor text.

### Bad Neighborhood

A "bad neighborhood" refers to the server where your site is hosted. A site hosted on a server that hosts other sites that spam or use black-hat SEO practices can end up penalized by search engines solely because of their proximity to those sites. In other words, be very careful about which web host you choose, what their terms of service are, and how strictly they enforce those terms if you want to avoid being penalized because of what your neighbors are doing. Linking to sites in bad neighborhoods can also have a negative effect on your search rankings.

<figure><a href="#"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async"  class="alignnone" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/75bc2354-414c-42d7-84b3-5b6f4e0be151/badneighborhood.jpg" alt="Web Design Industry Jargon and Web Terms" width="480" height="360" /></a></figure>

### Bandwidth

Bandwidth can refer to two different things: the rate at which data can be transferred or the total amount of data allowed to be transferred from a web host during a given month (or other hosting service term) before overage charges are applied. It is generally referred to in term of bits-per-second (bps), kilobits per second (kbs), or other metric measurements. Lower bandwidth internet connections (such as dial-up) mean data loads slower than with high bandwidth connections (like cable or fiber).

*   [Bandwidth Explained](https://www.findmyhosting.com/bandwidth.htm) from FindMyHosting.com

### Below the Fold

This term is a carry-over from newspaper publishing days. In newspaper terms, "below the fold" means content was on the bottom half of the page (below the physical fold in the paper). In web design terms, "below the fold" refers to the content that is generally going to be below the point first viewable to the average website visitor in their browser (in other words, viewers would have to scroll down to see the content).

<figure><a href="#"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async"  class="alignnone" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/353833ef-5ba3-4498-bd01-b38531d3c932/belowthefold.jpg" alt="Web Design Industry Jargon" width="480" height="360" /></a></figure>

### Bounce Rate

A website's bounce rate is the percentage of people who leave the site from the same page they entered the site, without clicking through to any other pages. This can be a good indicator of how good a website's navigation is, as well as an indicator of the quality of the site's content (a very high bounce rate doesn't bode well for either of those things).

### Breadcrumb

Breadcrumbs are the bit of navigation elements that generally appear near the top of a give web page that show you the pages and subpages the appear before the page you're on. For examples, on a blog, the breadcrumbs might look something like: Home &gt; Category &gt; Year &gt; Month &gt; Post (or they might be a lot simpler that that). The breadcrumbs term comes from the fairy tale "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansel_and_Gretel">Hansel and Gretel</a>."

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async"  src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/5273d7c1-2d57-4c0b-bdf7-7ea350c3e8bd/breadcrumbs.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="480" height="62" /></figure>

### Browser

Browser refers to the program a website visitor is using to view the web site. Examples include Safari, Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, and Internet Explorer.

<figure><a href="#"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async"  src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/84985c72-8aa4-47d0-b589-458149913a86/browser.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="480" height="360" /></a></figure>

## C

### Cache/Caching

Cached files are those that are saved or copied (downloaded) by a web browser so that the next time that user visits the site, the page loads faster.

### Cascading Style Sheets

Also referred to simply as CSS, <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/07/css-specificity-things-you-should-know/">Cascading Style Sheets</a> are used to define the look and feel of a web site outside of the actual HTML file(s) of the site. In recent years, CSS has replaced tables and other HTML-based methods for formatting and laying out websites. The benefits to using CSS are many, but some of the most important are the simplification of a site's HTML files (which can actually increase search engine rankings) and the ability to completely change the style of a site by changing just one file, without having to make changes to content.

<figure><a href="#"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async"  src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/24ca5216-a95d-48c8-8d20-7152689f3d82/css.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="480" height="322" /></a></figure>

### Client-Side

Client-side refers to scripts that are run in a viewer's browser, instead of on a web server (as in server-side scripts). Client-side scripts are generally faster to interact with, though they can take longer to load initially.

### Content Management System

Also known as a CMS, the Content Management System is a backend tool for managing a site's content that separates said content from the design and functionality of the site. Using a CMS generally makes it easier to change the design or function of a site independent of the site's content. It also (usually) makes it easier for content to be added to the site for people who aren't designers.

### Comment

In web design terms, a comment is a bit of information contained in a site's HTML or XHTML files that is ignored by the browser. Comments are used to identify different parts of the file and as reference notes. Good commenting makes it much easier for a designer (whether the original designer or someone else) to make changes to the site, as it keeps it clear which parts of the code perform which functions. There are different comment formats for different programming and markup languages.

*   [HTML Cheat Sheet](https://websitesetup.org/html5-cheat-sheet/)

### CSS

See <em>Cascading Style Sheets</em>.</p>

### CSS Framework

A CSS framework is a collection of CSS files used as the starting point to make XHTML and CSS web sites quickly and painlessly. They usually contain CSS styles for typography and layout.

## D

### Deprecated

Deprecated code is code that is no longer included in the language specifications. Generally this happens because it is replaced with more accessible or efficient alternatives.

### DHTML

Stands for Dynamic HyperText Markup Language. DHTML fuses XHTML (or any other markup language), the DOM, JavaScript (or other scripts), and CSS (or other presentation definition languages) to create interactive web content.

*   [DHTML Explained](https://www.yourhtmlsource.com/javascript/dhtmlexplained.html) from HTMLSource

### Dither

In GIF and certain other image formats, there is a limited color palette used for each image. Because of this, not all colors in an image are presented. Dither is used to approximate these colors by combining pixels of different colors side by side.

<figure><a href="#"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async"  src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ef797a35-2ff0-48b5-8c08-8b3ab3b96601/dither.gif" alt="Screenshot" width="480" height="360" /></a></figure>

### DNS

Stands for Domain Name Service (alternately Domain Name System or Domain Name Server). Basically, it's the thing that converts IP addresses into domain names. DNS servers are provided with the IP address of your web server when you assign your domain name to those servers. In turn, when someone types your domain name into their web browser, those DNS servers translate the domain name to the IP address and point the browser to the correct web server.

*   [How Domain Name Servers Work](https://www.howstuffworks.com/dns.htm) from HowStuffWorks

### Doctype

The doctype declaration specifies which version of HTML is used in a document. It has a direct effect on whether your HTML will validate.

<figure><span class="removed_link" title="https://www.goodbytes.be/index.php/blog/article/css_footer_onderaan_scherm_klevend/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async"  src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/52ff030c-9c43-4fe4-8c92-96ab6a7b0218/doctype.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="480" height="100" /></span></figure>

*   [Choosing a DOCTYPE](https://htmlhelp.com/tools/validator/doctype.html) from Web Design Group

### Dom, The

Stands for Document Object Model. It's a language-indpendent, cross-platform convention for representing objects in XML, XHTML, and HTML documents. Rules for interacting with and programming the DOM are specified in the DOM API.

*   [DOM (Document Object Model) Reference](https://www.javascriptkit.com/domref/) from JavaScript Kit
*   [The Document Object Model Dissected](https://www.wdvl.com/Authoring/DHTML/DOM/) from Web Developer's Virtual Library

### Domain

The domain is the name by which a website is identified. The domain is associated with an IP address. Domains can be purchased with any combination of letters, hyphens (-), and numbers (though it can't start with a hyphen). Depending on the extension (.com, .net, .org, etc.), a domain can be anywhere up to 26 to 63 characters long.

### DTD

Stands for Document Type Definition. DTD is one of several SGML and XML schema languages. It provides a list of the attributes, comments, elements, entities, and notes in a document along with their relationships to each other.

## E

### E-Commerce

Short for electronic commerce. It's the buying and selling of goods online, through websites. Products sold through e-commerce can be physical products that require shipping, or digital products delivered electronically.

### Elastic Layout

An elastic layout is one that uses percentages and ems for widths paired with a max-width style to allow the site layout to stretch when font sizes are changed. It's ability to flex to accommodate the browser width and reader's font preferences are where it gets its name.

<figure><a href="#"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async"  src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7025b32f-52bd-4ff8-a0c6-ba4cd142dfde/elasticlayout.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="480" height="315" /></a></figure>

*   [Archive for Elastic Layout](https://www.cssglance.com/category/gallery/layout-technique/elastic-layout/) from CSSGlance Gallery

### Element

In XML, an element is the central building block of any document. Individual elements can contain text, other elements, or both.

*   [The Basics of Using XML Schema to Define Elements](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/xml-schema/) from IBM

### Em

Em is a unit of measurement for sizing fonts and other elements within a web page relative to the item's parent element. A 1em font is equal to the point size for the font already defined in the parent element (2em would be twice the current size; .5em would be half the current size).

*   [Effective Style with em](https://mondaybynoon.com/effective-style-with-em/) from Monday By Noon

### Embedded Style

An embedded style is a CSS style written into the head of an XHTML document. It only effects the elements on that page, instead of site-wide as a separate CSS file does. Style in an embedded style sheet will override styles from the linked CSS file.

### Ex

Ex is a measurement for font height or size relative to the height of a lowercase "x" in that font family.

### Extensible Markup Language

Otherwise known as XML. XML is a markup language used for writing custom markup languages. In other words, XML describes how to write new languages (it's sometimes referred to as a "meta" language because of this). It also serves as a basic syntax that allows different kinds of computers and applications to share information without having to go through multiple conversion layers.

<figure><a href="#"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async"  src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/977559a9-f124-41e8-9761-f208dad12030/xml.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="480" height="360" /></a></figure>

### External Style Sheet

This is a CSS document that is written in a separate, external document. The biggest advantage to using an external style sheet is that it can be linked to by multiple HTML/XHTML files (which means changes made to the style sheet will effect all the pages linked to it without having to change each page individually).

## F

### Favicon

Favicons are tiny (generally 16x16 pixels, though some are 32x32 pixels), customizable icons displayed in the web address bar in most browsers next to the web address. They're either 8-bit or 24-bit in color depth and are saved in either .ico, .gif or .png file formats.

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async"  src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f903c6af-14ce-47ac-9f18-7de0ded7b06b/favicons.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="290" height="290" /></figure>

A fixed width layout has a set width (generally defined in pixels) set by the designer. The width stays the same regardless of screen resolution, monitor size, or browser window size. It allows for minute adjustments to be made to a design that will stay consistent across browsers. Designers have more control over exactly how a site will appear across platforms with this type of layout.

### Focal Point

The focal point of a web site is the spot on a web page that they eye is naturally drawn to. This could be an image, a banner, text, Flash content, or just about anything else. You want to make sure that whatever is acting as your focal point is the most important part of your site.

<figure><a href="#"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async"  src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/6839c215-0781-42ca-b8f4-9a0c43241a51/focalpoint.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="480" height="320" /></a></figure>

### Fold

The fold is a term carried over from newspaper design and pagination (where the fold referred to the physical fold in the paper). The fold in a website is the point on the webpage that rests at the bottom of someone's browser (in other words, to see anything below the fold, they would have to scroll down). There are varying opinions on how important the fold is in web design.

### Font Family

Font family is a group designation for defining the typefaces used in CSS documents. The font family tag generally lists multiple fonts to be used, and usually ends with the generic font category (such as "serif" or "sans-serif').

<figure><a href="#"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async"  src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/5b906a24-fe6e-494f-a13c-5d1ae0fa4ed4/fontfamily.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="480" height="330" /></a></figure>

### Font Weight

The font weight refers to how thick or thin (bold or light) a font looks.

*   [font-weight](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/font-weight) from Mozilla Developer Center

### Front-End

The front-end is basically the opposite of the back-end. It's all the components of a website that a visitor to the site can see (pages, images, content, etc.) Specifically, it's the interface that visitors use to access the site's content. It's also sometimes referred to as the User Interface.

### Graceful Degradation

Graceful degradation refers to a website's ability to have elements that may take advantage of the capabilities of newer browsers done in a way that allows users with older browsers to still view the site in a manner that at least allows access to basic content. It also applies to making sure that if one small portion of your site doesn't work in someone's browser, it doesn't break your entire site for them.

<figure><a href="#"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async"  src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/182e67c5-7a85-4dbd-a721-7cfd940152a9/gracefuldegradation.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="480" height="300" /></a></figure>

### Graphical User Interface

Also referred to by its acronym: GUI. A graphical user interface uses an input device (like the mouse) and visual representations of how the user is able to interact with a web application. In other words, it's all the front-end stuff you see on a web application. It's purpose is to allow you to interact with a web application without having to enter code.

### Hexadecimal

Also referred to a "hex" numbers, they are a base-16 numbering system used to define colors online. Hex numbers include the numerals 0-9 and letters A-F. Hexadecimal numbers are written in three sets of hex pairs. Because screen colors are RGB (Red, Green, Blue), the first pair defines the red hue, the second pair defines the green hue, and the third pair defines the blue.

<figure><a href="#"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async"  src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/17388ca1-7a89-47f4-ae59-ed9a8b05e1ea/hexadecimal.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="480" height="320" /></a></figure>

### Hit

Contrary to popular belief, a hit does not represent a single visitor to a website. A hit is actually a request for a single file from your web server. This means one page can actually generate multiple hits, as each page generally has more than one file (an html or other base file, a css file, multiple images, etc.) and each one is requested from the server whenever the page is loaded. Some marketing people like to quote hits to unknowing consumers as the number makes their site sound like it's getting a whole lot more traffic than it actually is.

### .htaccess

The .htaccess file is the default directory-level configuration file on Apache servers. They are also known as "distributed configuration files." Configuration directives contained in the .htaccess file apply to the directory in which the file is placed as well as all of its subdirectories. Within the .htaccess file things like authorization and authentication, rewriting of URLs, cache control and customized error responses can all be specified.

### HTML

Stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It's the primary language used to write web pages. HTML is primarily intended as a way to provide <em>content</em> on websites (with CSS handling the layout and stylistic options), though it can also be used to determine how that content is displayed.

<figure><a href="#"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async"  src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/3ec8b828-44df-4ddd-bf16-1ad9a2f2892d/html.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="480" height="360" /></a></figure>

### HTTPS

Similar to HTTP, HTTPS stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol over SSL (Secure Socket Layer) or, alternately, HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure. Like HTTP, it's a set of rules for transferring hypertext requests between browsers and servers, but this time it's done over a secure, encrypted connection.

### Hyperlink

A hyperlink is a link from one web page to another, either on the same site or another one. Generally these are text or images, and are highlighted in some way (text is often underlined or put in a different color or font weight). The inclusion of hyperlinks are the "hyper" part of "hypertext."

<figure><a href="#"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async"  src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7025b32f-52bd-4ff8-a0c6-ba4cd142dfde/elasticlayout.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="480" height="164" /></a></figure>

### Link Farm

A link farm is any website setup specifically to increase the link popularity of other websites by increasing the number of incoming links to that site. While some link farms are single pages listing unrelated links, others consist of networks of sites that contain multiple links back and forth to one another. Search engines can generally recognize these types of schemes and often remove link farms from their directories and penalize the sites linking to and from them.

### Liquid Layout

A liquid layout is one that is based on percentages of the browser window's size. The layout of the site will change with the width of the browser, even if the visitor changes their browser size while viewing the page. Liquid layouts take full advantage of a person's browser width, optimizing the amount of content you can fit onscreen at one time.

### Permalink

Short for "permanent link." Generally used only on blogs, a permalink is a link that is the permanent web address of a given blog post. Since most blogs have constantly-changing content, the permalink offers a way for readers to bookmark or link to specific posts even after those posts have moved off the home page or primary category page.

### Resolution

Refers to the physical number of pixels displayed on a screen (such as 1280x1024). Unlike in print, display resolution does not refer to the number of pixels or dots per inch on a computer screen, as this can be changed by changing the resolution of the screen (which, of course, does not change the physical size of the screen). The resolution of an image, however, is often referred to in terms of pixels per inch, though this has very little effect on how the image is displayed on screen.

### Semantic Markup

In semantic markup, content is written within XHTML tags that offer context to what the content contains. Basic semantic markup refers to using items like header and paragraph tags, though semantic markup is also being used to provide much more useful context to web pages in an effort to make the web as a whole more semantic.

### Server-Side

Server-side refers to scripts run on a web server, as opposed to in a user's browser. Server-side scripts often take a bit longer to run than a client-side script, as each page must reload when an action is taken.
