  A lot of what is seen on TV commercials, catalogues flyers, posters, banners
  and internet advertisments are made by someone in the world of design or
  commissioned by someone in the world of art. As time passes, the distinction
  between artist and designer has been blurred beyond recognition.

  Now, in times of instant press and release, inspiration from great artistic
  measures and processes are the influence and is just as important as
  functionality. When we see companies like Apple and RIM, we see a
  **collaboration between art and design** where the practicality is the
  designated, artistic measure and process, so what looks good, feels good and
  works well.

  Below is done in the same sight, literally where the eyes are encouraged to
  explore, stimulating inspiration and aspirational ambition. Below we present
  **40 talented and impressive illustrators** – their work is inspiring,
  creative, original and beautiful and as such perfect for a lousy saturday
  evening.

<a href="https://www.hejz.com/">Peter Jaworowski</a>
Peter Jaworowski is an innovative graphic designer that has a nack for bringing something almost unthought of to the table. His usage of lighting and the below water and ink effects that has been pushing is something to be inspired by. Peter "J" is wild in presentation to his clients and on his commissions as art director. His attention the detail in effects make different than the "No Pattern" look that people are taking a trend hop for. I think a lot of what he has to offer is in his passion for what he can do in his attention to that peculiar detail.

Pete Harrison has some minute attention to detail that shows just what a few simple shapes and brushes and selections can do for his work.
