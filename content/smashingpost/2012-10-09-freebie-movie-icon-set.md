## Description

Perhaps you'd like to showcase your interests in your portfolio, or perhaps an obscure indie filmmaker has asked you to put up a small site for their upcoming movie. Or maybe you are organizing a party and would like to invite your good ol' friends or colleagues to a movie evening. Eventually you might end up looking for a set of original cinema or TV-related icons, and purchasing generic stock icons isn't really an option. In these (and hopefully many other) cases, this icon set might be useful.

This set contains 10 images related to film, movies and the movie-going experience. Each icon is available in six sizes: its original size, 256×256px, 128×128px, 64×64px, 32×32px and 16×16px. The icons included are:

*   Ticket
*   Anaglyph Glasses
*   Camera
*   Cinema Seat
*   Clapperboard
*   Soft Drink
*   Film Reel
*   Megaphone
*   Popcorn
*   TV Set

The icons are licensed under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license</a>. You are free to distribute, transform, fiddle with and build them into your work, even commercially. However, please always credit the original designer of the set (in this case, Nikolay Kuchkarov).

### Behind The Design

As always, here are some insights from the designer:
<blockquote>"My inspiration was the <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/06/18/freebie-academic-icon-set-10-png-psd-icons/">Academic Icon Set</a>. I saw this amazing set and decided to make my own, and today I am honored to share the results with you all. This icon set is the result of about a month of work, and I hope that you will love it!"
