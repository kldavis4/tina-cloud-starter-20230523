We returned to our home in Freiburg for the 2019 SmashingConf, and brought all the SmashingConf fun with us. We‚Äôve wrapped up the event in this post, including links to the video of all of the presentations, so you can relive what you enjoyed &mdash; or share in something of what you missed.

## The Presentations

<p>The main focus of the conference is the speakers and the presentations they bring. As with all of our 2019 events, some speakers opted to present without slides. In the tables below, I‚Äôve linked to slides for those talks which had them, plus the video of each presentation. Enjoy two days worth of learning from the comfort of your own couch!</p>

### Day One

The [Day One Collaborative Doc](https://smashed.by/magic) created by attendees is full of takeaways from the first day of the conference. R√©mi Parmentier used our stage to launch his project ‚Äú<a href="https://www.caniemail.com/">Can I Email...?</a>‚Äù, a site which aims to do for HTML email what *Can I Use* does for web platform features.

### Day Two

Check out the [Day Two Collaborative Doc](https://smashed.by/fantasy) for more resources and thoughts from our attendees and speakers.

Our mystery speaker was Seb Lester. No-one managed to guess the theme mystery, although there was a suggestion it might be the panda that was sat on stage!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Mystery revealed. Beautiful and inspiring talk by <a href="https://twitter.com/SebLester?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SebLester</a>. &quot;Believe in yourself&quot; <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/smashingconf?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#smashingconf</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/mysteryspeaker?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#mysteryspeaker</a> <a href="https://t.co/AqSwkV54cP">pic.twitter.com/AqSwkV54cP</a></p>&mdash; Anna Karon (@anqa_ka) <a href="https://twitter.com/anqa_ka/status/1171349848760705024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 10, 2019</a></blockquote>

We then enjoyed talks covering a wide range of topics from our day two speakers. Our final speaker, Heather, also announced her new book, which she will be publishing through Smashing Books! Heather also wrote up [a post](https://webdevlaw.uk/2019/09/28/a-smashing-talk-and-my-big-announcement/) in which she shares her thoughts on speaking at Smashing Conf and also answers lots of questions from the audience that she didn't have time to during the Q&amp;A session.

## Workshops

Our workshops are a big part of each of our Smashing conferences. In Freiburg, workshops were held the day after the conference. This time round, we saw the following workshops:

## Side Activities

A conference isn‚Äôt just about the talks and speakers. We want to make spaces where attendees and speakers can learn from each other and share experiences in a more informal setting. We want to offer something for everyone &mdash; from the party-goers to the fitness enthusiasts, and everyone in-between! So at lunchtime, we had lunch sessions: On Day 1, we saw the "Web We Want" panel discussion from Microsoft, and on Day 2, Deque ran a session in which attendees could grab a plate of lunch and settle down in a more cozy environment to take part.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/drewm/albums/72157710911878963/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d16537fa-e142-432e-bb38-a280a707d4c2/smashing-freiburg-webwewant.jpg" sizes="100vw" caption="‚ÄòThe Web We Want‚Äô panel (Photo credit: <a href='https://drewm.photo'>Drew McLellan</a>)" alt="Three women panelists" >}}

We had a great lounge area, with the talks live-streamed where some attendees spent time watching talks and building lego or doing jigsaw puzzles.

We enjoyed all of these things powered by excellent coffee from a barista stand, sponsored by our friends at [Honeypot](https://honeypot.io/).

### Morning Run

If you follow me on Twitter, you‚Äôll know that I‚Äôm a keen runner, and it‚Äôs always nice to have some company on an early morning run. For a few conferences now, we‚Äôve been organizing pre-conference runs &mdash; Freiburg was no exception. Runners joined me on both days for 5k along the river &mdash; we even avoided the rain.

### Jam Session

The Jam Session this time round was hosted by Shopify. Attendees spent time socializing and hearing some lightning talks.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thanks to our <a href="https://twitter.com/Shopify?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Shopify</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/smashingconf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@smashingconf</a> friends for hosting a great jam session tonight! <br><br>If you missed <a href="https://twitter.com/theHarrisius?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@theHarrisius</a>&#39;s talk on axe-pro and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/a11y?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#a11y</a>, be sure to visit us at our booth or sign-up for the axe-pro beta: <a href="https://t.co/ONZgYIRkpA">https://t.co/ONZgYIRkpA</a> <a href="https://t.co/6DsDxI1C1Y">pic.twitter.com/6DsDxI1C1Y</a></p>&mdash; Deque Systems (@dequesystems) <a href="https://twitter.com/dequesystems/status/1170812798085074944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 8, 2019</a></blockquote>

### The Planetarium, Cable Car and Photo Walk

On the Sunday before the conference, some hardy souls took a trip up the [Schauinsland Cable Car](https://www.schauinslandbahn.de/en/). It's the longest loop cable car in Germany, and everyone had fun despite the weather being less than ideal for views from the top.

After Day 1, everyone was invited to enjoy a show at the [Freiburg Planetarium](https://www.planetarium-freiburg.de/) before heading over to the after-conf party. Our party this year was held at *Gr√ºnhof Freiburg* and sponsored by [Speedcurve](https://speedcurve.com/). Speakers and attendees were able to enjoy time together in the garden there, as the weather had improved from the previous day!

After Day 2, many attendees enjoyed a history photo walk around beautiful Freiburg, learning more about the town and having the chance to take some photos.

## Want To Join In The Fun?

We packed a lot into those few days! If you were there, we hope that you enjoyed it as much as we did. It was great to meet so many of you.
