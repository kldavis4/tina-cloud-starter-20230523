## News

*   Chrome introduces [custom tabs](https://blog.chromium.org/2015/09/chrome-custom-tabs-smooth-transition_2.html) and smooth transitions, allowing apps to preload specific URLs in the in-app browser for a faster user experience.
*   Facebook [released](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools/releases/tag/0.14.1) a complete rewrite of their React developer tools, now available for Firefox as well.</p>

## Concepts & Design

<figure><a href="https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/56797df0-ea5e-4f77-805c-f763c7570ea5/hack-typeface-opt.png" alt="Hack Typeface" width="500" height="233" /></a></figure>

*   [Hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/) is a typeface that has specifically been designed for coding, is free and open source.
*   In times of more and more single page applications and increasing user interaction, it’s important to put more effort into error messages. Thomas Fuchs explains “[How To Write An Error Message](https://medium.com/@thomasfuchs/how-to-write-an-error-message-883718173322)”.
*   “[Making Selected Button States Clear for Color Blind Users](https://uxmovement.com/buttons/making-selected-button-states-clear-for-color-blind-users/)”.</p>

## Tools

*   [Mailchimp published their new styleguide](https://styleguide.mailchimp.com/) and open sourced it, so you can use the same structure in your projects.
*   In teams where people are working remotely, the status call can be challenging. But tools like [Flock](https://heyflock.com/) or [tatsu](https://tatsu.io/) which also integrates seamlessly into Slack.
*   [Toxy](https://github.com/h2non/toxy) is a customizable HTTP(S) proxy to simulate failure scenarios and unexpected network conditions.
*   If you have a lot of contributions not being part of your workflow, it can be challenging to get code in your preferred style. Now, Sindre Sorhus gives you [xo](https://github.com/sindresorhus/xo), a tool that converts code to your preferred style.</p>

## Web Performance

*   Paul Kinlan had the pleasure to work from India for a week and shares his insights [on network quality](https://paul.kinlan.me/the-web-in-india-anecdote-3/), [browser usage](https://paul.kinlan.me/the-web-in-india-anecdote-2/) and the difference of [what works in proxy browsers and what doesn’t](https://paul.kinlan.me/the-web-in-india-anecdote-1/).
*   Making sense of [prefetching, preloading, prebrowsing](https://css-tricks.com/prefetching-preloading-prebrowsing/).</p>

## HTML / SVG

<figure><a href="https://jakearchibald.com/2015/anatomy-of-responsive-images/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/b0eb9ca0-235c-4544-bc9d-0bba63514ed6/rwd-img-opt.png" alt="Responsive images explained" width="500" height="274" /></a></figure>

*   Jake Archibald explains responsive images again. It’s a short, intuitive and descriptive so [everyone can master `picture`, `srcset` and `sizes` now](https://jakearchibald.com/2015/anatomy-of-responsive-images/).</p>

## Accessibility

*   [react-a11y](https://github.com/rackt/react-a11y) is a react tool that warns you about potential accessibility issues in your code.

## JavaScript

*   While UA sniffing is unreliable, there are also some [problems with feature detection](https://blog.html5test.com/2015/08/the-problems-with-feature-detection/). With feature detection we always assume that if a feature is reported to be there, it also works properly. And that’s a false assumption.
*   When you have JavaScript driven link handlers you often face the problem that when going back in URL history, the scroll position is not ideal. Now, Chrome tries to fix this by providing the [`history.scrollRestoration`](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/09/history-api-scroll-restoration) in the History API.</p>

## CSS / Sass

*   Patrick Brosset [introduces the new CSS Grid layout technique](https://medium.com/@patrickbrosset/css-grid-layout-6c9cba6e8a5a) from the beginning with great examples.</p>

## Work & Life

*   Depression, often only temporarily experienced, can be quite a challenge for humans. Seeing more and more people in web development struggling with health, work-life balance or the impostor syndrome I feel we need to take more care of ourselves. One thing I experienced to work well was doing a challenging sport when I struggled with my work. In my case, the best I could do is go to the climbing gym and go bouldering. It is basically like climbing but without a rope, partner and only up to about 4m high with pads under you if you fall. [Tiffany shares in this article how she saved her life](https://cruxcrush.com/2015/08/20/climbing-out-of-depression/) by going climbing. I am sure there are more sports achieving the same results but be sure to choose a workout that is challenging and you need concentration, because that is key to what Tiffany helped.
*   Tobias Tom shares how he learned to love talking to other people in co-working spaces and the [challenge to replace real people with a virtual office](https://tobiastom.name/articles/dealing-with-virtual-offices) when working remote again.</p>

## Go beyond…

*   [Trash pollution is affecting the whole world](https://edition.cnn.com/2015/02/12/world/ocean-trash-pollution/index.html) and plastic is the worst. Used by a critical mass as late as of 1954 we now have an uncontrollable wast of plastic in the oceans of the world and on many other places around the world. Thinking of how we managed to waste our planet in only about 60 years, it is time to choose less plastic. Next time you go shopping think if you really need another plastic bag (instead bring your own linen) or buy some solid wood toy for babies (it is also healthier for them).
*   Well, we already heard some weird things about Uber in the past. But this [opinion article](https://edition.cnn.com/2015/08/28/opinions/cevallos-uber/) is bothering me a lot. It shows how social and human we are: We still don’t care about other people as long as life is as convenient as it can be. Despite this article, judges have made [some interesting](https://www.wired.com/2015/09/judge-california-drivers-can-go-class-action-sue-uber/) [decisions](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/02/technology/uber-rebuffed-by-judge-in-ruling-on-drivers-suit.html?_r=0) regarding the drivers’ employment status and the [EU considers to regulate Uber](https://recode.net/2015/08/28/to-regulate-or-not-eu-to-launch-study-on-uber/). Uber meanwhile invests heavily in the self-driving business and fights back against any lawsuit where drivers fight for better work conditions.

And with that I’ll close for this week.

Thanks and all the best,
