Everyday, we go through hundreds of different websites. With Twitter and RSS feeds, we are able to see an excessive amount of sites in just a short time. Most of the websites that we visit are forgettable, they don't leave a lasting impression.

## There are different ways that we remember a website.

1.  **The Content** We remember Smashing Magazine, Web Designer Depot, and other blogs because we go to those websites daily for their great content.
2.  **The Design** Some websites have extremely creative designs. These websites are easy to remember as well.
3.  **The "Wow" Facto**r Sometimes, while looking at a website and browsing through its pages, we will see something that will make us say "Wow!" It could be a simple transition, a background change, a color switch, or even a unique animation that will cause us to remember the website. **That is what I call the "wow" factor.**

## The "Wow" Factor

<blockquote>"It's the little details that are vital. Little things make big things happen."

— Coach John Wooden</blockquote>

I believe that the "wow" factor is very important in web design. It is what can set your website apart from the myriad of different websites in your industry. By the way, this doesn't have to be anything mind-boggling or extremely complicated, just something simple but clever will do the trick. This will definitely leave a lasting impression on your viewers and will make them remember your website.

While there are plenty of websites that make use of this technique, I have gathered<strong> 10 well-designed websites with clever little details that made me say "Wow!"</strong>

### [Analog](https://analog.coop/)

Analog is a company of friends who make web sites. It’s a co-operative where imagination, design, and engineering thrive; good people doing good work. The website is very simple, but it definitely gets the job done.

<strong>The "Wow" Factor</strong>

Try pressing Alt+G and see what happens. Also, mouse-over the mugshots.

### Face

Face is an intelligence-driven multidisciplinary design studio, based in Monterrey, Mexico whose work range includes design solutions, advertising, editorial projects and custom publishing, corporate identity and brand development. The site is very minimalistic, and at first look, it doesn't seem to be exciting at all.

<strong>The "Wow" Factor</strong>

Mouse-over the navigation and you'll be surprised.

### [Flourish](https://www.floridaflourish.com/)

Flourish is a full-service design studio with a decided focus on the Web. With additional experience in brand identity, print design and photography. This is probably one of my favorite websites in the internet. It is well designed and it has some great details that really make you say "wow!"

<strong>The "Wow" Factor</strong>

When clicking one of the 4 red banners, the tree changes. Also, the featured projects slider is great.

### [HutchHouse](https://hutchhouse.com/)

The Hutchhouse team have a mass of real life web design experience creating interfaces for simple brochure websites through to eCommerce, intranet and social networking sites. I love the giraffe illustrations in this website.

<strong>The "Wow" Factor</strong>

On the top right corner, try switching the theme and you will see the giraffes in different environments. They have a space theme, a night theme, a jungle theme, and a depth theme.

### Komodo Media

Komodo Media is a tiny web design studio and blog created, inspired by and maintained by Rogie King.He specializes in illustration, identity design, jQuery, JavaScript and is somewhat of a CSS/xHTML freak. He is pretty good with databases, PHP and Flash, but his heart loves and lives in the design and front-end scripting world.

<strong>The "Wow" Factor</strong>

Most of you have probably seen this website already, but the "wow" factor is definitely the foliage-o-meter. I still haven't seen any website do anything similar to what he has done.

### [Riot Industries](https://riotindustries.com/)

Riot Industries is the personal portfolio of designer Phil Renaud. He is a dual citizen, born and raised in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, which is basically Canadian Detroit. The website has a very nice texture to it, and the color palette really works well.

<strong>The "Wow" Factor</strong>

Mouseover any of the project thumbnails and the title will quickly slide out. Very neat effect!
