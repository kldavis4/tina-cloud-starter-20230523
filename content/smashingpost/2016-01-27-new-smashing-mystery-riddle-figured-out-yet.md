Yep, one of those [mystery](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-smashing-book-mystery-is-resolved-gifs-crazy-people-all-that-malarkey/) [riddles](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-mystery-resolved-the-rain-that-never-stops-frightened-cats-cake-is-a-lie/) [again](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/03/31/the-mystery-is-resolved-a-story-of-invisible-letters-and-shady-characters/)? To celebrate the launch of [SmashingConf NYC](https://smashingconf.com/ny-2016/), we’ve prepared yet another riddle, and this time it will be a matter of patience and following clues. As usual, **we’ve hidden secret <del>keys</del> hashtags in a series of animated GIFs.** There are 5 levels in total.

Below you’ll find the **first animated GIF, containing a location clue**. To move to the next level, you have to find a hidden hash tag and follow a link in a tweet containing it. Once you’ve reached the last level (you’ll know when), just tweet all of the keys in one single hash tag (or a screenshot if there isn’t enough characters left!) to [@smashingmag](https://twitter.com/smashingmag) on Twitter! Not _that_ difficult, right?

All right, let’s get down to business. Are you ready? Action! (And good luck!)
