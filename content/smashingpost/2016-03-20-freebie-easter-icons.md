### Insights From The Designer:

<blockquote>"I love icons. Drawing with vectors makes me happy, gives me a lot of fun and lets me express my passion. Each one of these icons is an explosion of creativity — this is the reason why I draw and love every little detail in them. Another aspect I love when I draw is, "Don’t follow rigid lines". I try not to use squares or circles, because I love imperfect lines. They make me think back to all the cartoons in my childhood, and as a lover of Mickey Mouse, I just have to follow my heart! ☺"</blockquote>
