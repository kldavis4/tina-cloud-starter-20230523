  **Book covers** are hard to design and nice to look at. An effective book
  cover manages to catch human's eye and convey the idea behind the book on one
  single page. However, it's getting even harder: to make a book really hard to

<strong>Book covers</strong> are hard to design and nice to look at. An effective book cover manages to catch human's eye and convey the idea behind the book on one single page. However, it's getting even harder: to make a book really hard to forget, designers need to design the cover in a unique, creative and striking way. That's not that different from Web where it's important to build a sound information architecture upon a rather restricted design layout. 

The main idea of this post is to provide you with some <strong>creative, expressive and appealing book covers</strong>. You won't like all of them, but you'll definitely find some designs which are worth pondering upon.</p>

Although this selection is definitely subjective, we've tried to do our best to find interesting designs which make the book cover hard to forget.
