**Exactly 9 years ago** we published the very first article on this very website. Many things changed since then, but one thing remained the same: our obsession for publishing valuable, practical quality content. We proudly stand behind our work — the books, the eBooks, the conferences; our craft is ours, but **our work serves the community and belongs to everybody**. As a team, we are happy and privileged to do what we truly love, and we know that this wouldn't be possible without your kind and generous support. So thanks for sticking around.

Now, a birthday calls for a birthday party, so we've prepared a little something for you to celebrate the day: a [chapter on responsive design patterns (free PDF)](#free-pdf-download), a [Mystery Riddle](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/09/the-new-smashing-mystery-riddle-have-you-figured-it-out-yet/), a new free eBook and a **birthday special**: if you [grab the hardcover](https://smashing-magazine.myshopify.com/cart/7170456259:1) of the _Smashing Book 5_ today, you'll get five Smashing eBooks as a gift for your kind support.</p>

## Smashing Book #5: Real-Life Responsive Web Design

We love taking up challenges, and with every new book we nudge ourselves a little bit harder to get the most relevant content out there. Looking back at last 9 years, every Smashing Book feels like a very special milestone, and the new "Real-Life Responsive Web Design" isn't an exception.

Now, responsive design is a default these days, but we are all still figuring out just the right process and techniques to better craft responsive websites. That’s why we created a new book — to **gather practical techniques and strategies** from people who have learned how to get things done right, in actual projects with actual real-world challenges.

Neatly packaged in a gorgeous hardcover, the book features practical front-end techniques and patterns from well-respected designers and developers. The book **isn’t concerned with trends or short-lived workarounds** — it should stand the test of time and as such, it’s focused on actual techniques used today in real-life projects. The techniques that you could apply to your websites today, too.

As designers and developers, we solve problems for a living. Yet, these problems are often quite tricky and complex, and the context of these problems requires us to be creative and flexible in our workflows. With responsive design, we are prompted to create scalable design systems that work well in unpredictable environments. To do that, we need to be pragmatic and find solutions that work well within given constraints. That’s why we created this book: to find techniques that have actually worked in real-life projects with <strong>real-world challenges</strong>.</p>

That's what native responsive images are for.<br /><br />In this chapter, Yoav discusses the different responsive images use cases and how we can use the native solution today to create performant responsive websites.

## The Book Gallery

Obviously nothing can replace the feeling of holding the books in your own hands, but here are a few photos to give you some idea of what the book feels like. But frankly: it's as beautiful as it is valuable.</p>

## Testimonials and Reviews

<blockquote class="testimonial testimonial--right grey"><br>
<p>It’s almost as if each author made a promise that you would not leave their “class” with any questions being left unanswered. That’s how in-depth the chapters are to me. The new Smashing Magazine book is outstanding. If you're designing or building responsive websites, it's a must-buy. Smashing Book #5 is now your RWD bible. Stop searching, buy this book, and spend a weekend filling your brain with the most useful, technical information on RWD you can find anywhere.</p>

<p>“Smashing Magazine’s fifth book is everything I've come to expect from the productions of Freiburg’s finest: Extensive, in-depth and beautifully rendered. But best of all it is wise; unafraid to step back from technicalities and take in the bigger picture. This isn’t just a book about how to do responsive design, but about what it really is and what it really means. So many web design books are mere manuals. This is a great deal more.”</p>

<p>A few years ago, my wife and I pushed Microsoft to embrace responsive design. Selling responsive design to an organization like Microsoft isn’t easy: it takes not only tact and diplomacy to overcome the inertia of habit and fear, but also a brand new skill set. For the latter, we did what we felt was best at the time—we pointed everyone at Ethan’s book, Responsive Web Design, and sheepishly nudged, “There’s more information about Responsive Design on the Internet.” <strong>Today, we’d have given each of them a copy of Real-Life Responsive Web Design instead of telling them to just “google it”.</strong></p>

<p>The chapters of the book are complimentary to each other, so the entire book is a collection of topics that go extremely well together, giving you a set of diverse topics that are sure to come in handy for any responsive design project you work on.</p>

<p>It’s not often I read a book twice but I’ll definitely be going back to re-read these chapters. They’re packed. So, good book? Yes, very good!</p>

<p>The book itself is a monster, a beautiful monster. At nearly 600 pages, printed in hardback with glorious typography and beautiful illustrations, it's one of the most eye-catching web-dev books I've ever read.</p>

<p>Reading the new Smashing book, which is timely as I'm spritifying some SVGs, and it's easier than flying @SaraSoueidan over to do it for me.</p>

<p>There is a chapter on SVG for RWD by Sara Soueidan that kind of made me feel stupid, not because of how it was written, that was great, but because it introduced me to <strong>so many new things about SVG</strong>. What the heck have I been learning all of these years?</p>
