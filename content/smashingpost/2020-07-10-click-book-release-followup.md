Paul Boag has written [three](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/printed-books/user-experience-revolution/) [books](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/printed-books/digital-adaptation/) in the Smashing Library, and *Click! How to Encourage Clicks Without Shady Tricks* is just the most recent one. Paul [wrote](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/04/landing-page-design/) [some](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/05/convince-others-against-dark-patterns/) [articles](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/06/test-design-concept-effectiveness/) for Smashing Magazine in addition to [appearing on the Smashing Podcast](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/03/smashing-podcast-episode-12/) and [SmashingTV](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/smashing-tv/live-ux-review-with-paul-boag/) to promote the book and talk about some of its themes. [Click! finally started shipping in June](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/printed-books/click/), and our beloved preorder customers found a surprise in those packages.

## This Time, It‚Äôs Personal

Paul signed 500 postcards‚Äîdesigned by our own [Ricardo Gimenez](https://www.ricardogimenes.com/) &mdash; and our first 500 buyers each received one of the signed postcards along with their copy of *Click!* 

It was fun to watch the reactions pop up on social media:

Paul‚Äôs an experienced author, and we also had a very experienced illustrator for the cover and interior templates‚Äî[Veerle Pieters](https://veerle.duoh.com/)! She has contributed artwork to Paul‚Äôs other books for Smashing, but [she also designed the cover for our first Smashing Magazine Print edition](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/09/design-process-cover-design-smashing-magazine-print/). The illustrations and templates she provided for *Click!* helped make the book an inspiration to read, too.

Working with an experienced author and a seasoned illustrator is always inspiring. There were even a few pleasant surprises along the way:

## Creativity In Quarantine

For a lot of us, quarantine has had a profound effect on our productivity levels. Feelings of being overwhelmed might be slowing you down, OR maybe your work is a welcome distraction, and you are getting a lot done right now. 

One thing that has changed for most of us is our routines, though. This inevitably leads to some problem solving, [which](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/quarantine-creative-teenagers-genz-coronavirus-covid19-technology/) [requires](https://link.medium.com/LIZdLIiQX7) [some](https://www.artworkarchive.com/blog/cultivating-a-creative-mindset-during-quarantine) [creativity](https://www.swaay.com/how-stay-creative-coronavirus-quarantine).

*Click!* comes along at a time when many of us need a creative ‚Äúnudge.‚Äù The book inspires us to think differently about our routines for building online sites and services‚Äîwhat works, and what doesn‚Äôt.

<blockquote>‚ÄúPeople are under enormous pressure to improve their conversion rates. Marketers have got targets they‚Äôve got to meet, designers are under pressure ... people are inevitably turning to dark patterns. Not because they want to, but because they‚Äôre under pressure to. They‚Äôre under pressure to bring about results.<br /><br />So the premise of this book is, first of all, to explain why dark patterns are a bad idea. I talk about it from a purely business point of view, that these are the business reasons why dark patterns are ultimately damaging. And then that inevitably leads to the question of, well, if dark patterns aren‚Äôt the answer, then what is?<br /><br />The majority of the book is exploring what you can do to improve your conversion rate without resorting to these kinds of more manipulative techniques.‚Äù<br /><br />&mdash; Paul Boag, <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/03/smashing-podcast-episode-12/">Smashing Podcast Episode 12</a></blockquote>
