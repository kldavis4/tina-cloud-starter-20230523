In this post we release yet another freebie: an original set of **four exclusive minimal, clean WordPress themes** designed by Marios Lublinski and released for web design community. As usual, the themes are free to use for private as well as commerical projects.

The themes are beautifully built with minimal and clean designs. These themes will come handy for artists, graphic designers, illustrators and photographers who’d like to have a clean, minimal portfolio to showcase their work.

The themes are simple but powerful, with a touch of traditional Swiss design and layout techniques. The unique style and design is what separates these themes from others. You will also be able to withhold the focus on your work, since *you* are the artist and should be in control of what the observer sees when visiting your site. Each one comes with a full video overview and support of how to use and manage it.

### Behind the Design

As always, here are some insights from the designer:

<blockquote>“As you know there are thousands of free and premium themes out there for you to use. So why design another WordPress theme? Unless you design something unique and remarkable. Since everybody is focus on the Framework, Post Formats, Parent/Child, Genesis. I decided to focus on you, the artist, since I will spend exactly 3.2 seconds on your new website, I want to see something unique, modern and innovative. I want to see *your* work, I want to focus *only* on your work, NOT on the theme itself. I know there are thousands of beautiful themes out there, but once you put your work inside those themes, your work will have disappeared and the theme will stand out than the rest. This is not what I wanted to create &mdash; I want your work to be the main focus, and the theme just to be a *support*.”</blockquote>

Thank you, Marios. We appreciate your work and your good intentions!
