  Almost everyone out there who runs a website has toyed with the idea of
  selling ads on their website. So many options are available. Dozens of ad
  and affiliate networks exist, and you have different ad formats to consider.
  Should you sell text ads or banner ads? Should you allow Flash ads? What about
  ads with sound, pop-ups or floating ads? People have so many decisions to make
  that they often just end up slapping on some AdSense code and calling it a
  day. And that's fine.

Almost everyone out there who runs a website has toyed with the idea of selling ads on their website. So many options are available. <strong>Dozens of ad and affiliate networks exist</strong>, and you have different ad formats to consider. Should you sell text ads or banner ads? Should you allow Flash ads? What about ads with sound, pop-ups or floating ads? People have so many decisions to make that they often just end up slapping on some AdSense code and calling it a day. And that's fine.

But you have a ton of other options for displaying ads on your website, from using other ad networks to selling and managing banner ads yourself. There are <strong>plug-ins for virtually every CMS and blogging platform out there</strong> that allow you to rotate banner ads or insert blocks of ad code.

This post is a collection of ad management plug-ins for WordPress, Movable Type, Drupal and Joomla! to get your started. At the end are a few tutorials for creating your own banner ad rotation scripts in PHP and ASP (so that even if a plug-in is not available for your CMS of choice, you'll likely be able to build your own).
