### Insights From The Designers

<blockquote>"We believe that when it comes to designing, nature in its all forms, shapes, and colors, is the best source to draw inspiration from. Most people, being overwhelmed with their busy schedules, often overlook all the beauty in the surrounding world. Here at GraphicMama, we find inspiration in everything and anything and that’s why we’ve decided to appreciate nature for all special gifts it present us with.

We’ve created this set of 12 flat geometric icons as a tribute to the uniqueness of each month of the year. What we did, was find one special feeling every month comes with and recreate it into a flat modern illustration. So, we came up with a beautiful and inspiring collection of 12 nature backgrounds and we hope you’ll love it."</blockquote>

A big thank you to the team at GraphicMama — we sincerely appreciate your time and efforts. Keep up the brilliant work!
