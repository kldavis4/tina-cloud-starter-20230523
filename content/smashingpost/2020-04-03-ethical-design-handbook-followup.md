Ethics is a timely subject for all of us who work on digital products, so it was no surprise *The Ethical Design Handbook* was well received. There is a real need for practical solutions beyond just complying with the law. The book offers ways to evaluate current practices, create opportunities for change when needed, and embed ethical design into your workflow.

## Something Good In The Mail

As printed copies started to make their way around the world, we got to see some happy responses and thoughtful reviews:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just got my new <a href="https://twitter.com/smashingmag?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@smashingmag</a> book in the mail today: The Ethical Design Handbook.<br><br>Super excited to dig in a little bit at a time. üìö <a href="https://t.co/XbDZwuwmN3">pic.twitter.com/XbDZwuwmN3</a></p>&mdash; Mayene üèùÔ∏èüçë #ACNH Creator ID: MA-7125-3087-2361 (@mayenedesign) <a href="https://twitter.com/mayenedesign/status/1243657519739719681?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 27, 2020</a></blockquote>

<blockquote>‚ÄúAfter reading this book it is suddenly very clear how saturated the digital realm is with manipulative design. And that it is staged with intent. ‚ÄúThe Ethical Design Handbook‚Äù teaches both the persuader and the persuaded what design for the most vulnerable looks like and how to avoid surveillance capitalism ‚Äì the root cause of unethical design.‚Äù<br /><br />&mdash; Mie Oehlenschlager, <a href="https://dataethics.eu/we-can-talk-about-ethical-design-till-the-cows-come-home-now-its-time-to-act/">Now It‚Äôs Time To Act</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The printed version of The Ethical Design Handbook arrived! Juhu and looking forward reading it and learning new things! <a href="https://twitter.com/smashingmag?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@smashingmag</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/trinefalbe?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@trinefalbe</a> ‚úåÔ∏è <a href="https://t.co/PbCFDmb8Ed">pic.twitter.com/PbCFDmb8Ed</a></p>&mdash; Joshua Schaer (@JoshuaSchaer) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoshuaSchaer/status/1237366440510046208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 10, 2020</a></blockquote>

<blockquote>‚ÄúTo assist in this decision-making the book also provides some really good practical tools and templates provided for assessing ethical considerations. I hope these will be put to good use by many readers. Throughout, there is an especially strong emphasis on the risks of collecting and managing personal data, and the importance of actually accumulating as little of it as possible. The walkthrough of different types of website cookies is also a great example of a useful artefact to enable relevant team discussions.‚Äù<br /><br />&mdash; Per Axbom, <a href="https://axbom.blog/the-ethical-design-handbook/">Managing Consequences of Design</a></blockquote>

This isn‚Äôt the first book for Trine Falbe, Martin Michael Frederiksen and Kim Andersen‚Äîthey are also the authors of [White Hat UX](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/printed-books/white-hat-ux/)‚Äîbut *The Ethical Design Handbook* brought its own unique challenges from the start. The authors had difficulty finding examples of good ethics. [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/), [Goodwings](https://www.goodwings.com/), and [LINGScars](https://www.lingscars.com/) are just a few of the ethical sites and services eventually showcased in the Handbook.

Another challenge came just a few days after the release of the book, as quarantine and lockdown orders spread around the world. The spread of COVID-19 dominated the news, and as events were either canceled, rescheduled, or moved online, we had to rethink traditional book release plans.

<blockquote> ‚ÄúWe felt it made most sense to stop actively marketing the book at that point. It just didn‚Äôt feel right to celebrate and to ask people to support us, when they clearly had so much to worry about.‚Äù<br /><br />&mdash; Trine Falbe</blockquote>

## Spreading The Word In Ethical Ways

The book launch party planned for UX Copenhagen had to be scrapped when the event went online. Falbe still presented ‚ÄúEthical Design Beyond the ‚ÄòFeel Good‚Äô‚Äù at the conference, raffled off a couple of books, and took questions from the audience.

The Ethical Design Handbook made a few guest appearances at the conference, too:

## Looking Forward

The use of online services, delivery apps, and teleconferencing is surging right now as we all find new ways to keep working, take care of each other, and stay connected. If the core mission of design is problem-solving, [maybe we DO need designers now more than ever](https://scottberkun.com/2020/world-needs-designers/).

Other disciplines focus on problem-solving too‚Äîengineers, doctors, teachers‚Äîand [the best of them](https://www.nspe.org/resources/ethics/code-ethics) [all have a code of ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath) [that informs professional behavior and decisions](https://acei.org/what-we-do/icoee/). Most of the time, these codes are more stringent than the law.

[There are ethical codes for business](https://www.scu.edu/ethics/focus-areas/business-ethics/resources/international-codes-of-conduct-for-businesses/), too. But dark patterns, poor privacy protections, and a lack of transparency are proof that many of our digital services are not built on ethical foundations. Companies that do build with ethics in mind don‚Äôt have to make big changes when new legislation like GDPR and CCPA becomes law.

Should designers insist on ethical projects and workflow? Can they? *The Ethical Design Handbook* gives us a place to start: **a business case for doing the right thing**.

The news around tech companies during the pandemic has made choices even more difficult for users. Tech companies with deep pockets and convenient services have [pounced](https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/3/26/21193902/tech-backlash-covid-19-coronavirus-google-facebook-amazon) on opportunities to improve their image, but it‚Äôs not all good news. Zoom, for example, is one of the more [accessible](https://zoom.us/accessibility) platforms for online meetings, and they‚Äôve made their [platform free for schools](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2020/03/13/zoom-video-coronavirus-eric-yuan-schools/). Zoom is also making headlines for [sending user data to Facebook](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/k7e599/zoom-ios-app-sends-data-to-facebook-even-if-you-dont-have-a-facebook-account) and [plenty of other ethical shortcomings](https://www.fastcompany.com/90483041/forget-facebook-zoom-is-the-tech-industrys-newest-problem-child). Many companies will grow during the pandemic, but the ones who stick to ethical practices might be able to keep those new customers.

<blockquote>‚ÄúIf I was running a company that actually protects people‚Äôs privacy (like join.me¬†for online meetings) I would make sure to surface that in my communication. Another important element is transparency. People are in a state of crisis, and the last thing we need is to feel tricked. If we find a product or service that treats us well, doesn‚Äôt hide costs, doesn‚Äôt violate our privacy, and does their best to be honest about it, we will stick with them.<br /><br />After all of this is over, we'll remember the companies and people that did good.‚Äù<br /><br />&mdash; Trine Falbe</blockquote>

## Tell Us Something Good

It‚Äôs a safe guess that Smashing readers are giving tech advice to a lot of family and friends right now. **What are your favorite ethically-made digital products? What services and apps are you recommending to others?** Let us know in the comments!
