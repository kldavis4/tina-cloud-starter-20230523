It's not only the design of products that makes Apple's products different, it's also their appearance on the Web and in print.

No other company has managed to come up with such a crisp and brilliant style of presenting its recent designs as a new breakthrough innovation that will change our lives for a long time. Apple has found an extremely effective way to deliver its message to a wide audience, and Apple's look and feel has played a major role in shaping that way.</p>
