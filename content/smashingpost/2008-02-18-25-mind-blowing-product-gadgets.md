### Sound Speaker System 500 XL

500 XL is a pretty unusual <strong>loud speaker system</strong>. "Sometimes bigger IS really better, especially when it comes to sound.

How great will these look on your desktop alongside your mp3 player or PC?" Price: unknown.

### Alpha TV Love

Price: unknown.

### Lunch Bags

The same oilcloth that covers your kitchen table can transport your children's lunches — or your own — in leak-free style. These reusable lunch bags will cut back on waste since they can simply be washed with a damp sponge (oilcloth is not washing-machine safe). Use a single pattern for the whole bag, or cut out complementary patterns or solid colors for side panels. You can attach small Velcro tabs to hold the bags closed, or clip the tops with colorful wooden clothespins.

### On/Off Mug

"At plain sight On/Off Mug is a standard <strong>black mug</strong> as they come a dime a dozen and in big white letters it say OFF.

### Logitech Di-Novo Mini & Di-Novo Edge

"All you long-time diNovo loving fans can take heart — Logitech's finally given a major overhaul to our favorite ultraslim, tactile, <strong>stylie keyboard and mouse</strong>. The new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2006/10/03/logitech-launches-dinovo-edge/">diNovo Edge</a> (which runs on Bluetooth, of course) finally fixes some of the long standing issues we've had with the keyboard, including having an integrated battery (plus dock / charging cradle, much like Logitech's mice have long since had -- a single charge should supposedly last two months), light-up function keys that show which key mode you're in."

<figure><img title="Keyboard" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a25bacf9-9ff8-4acf-af15-8b745c35f8be/dinovok.jpg" alt="Keyboard" width="450" height="402" /></figure>

### Bonus: Home Theater

No, it's not for sale, but it should be! The music engineer Jeremy Kipnis sure knows his entertainment. His gigantic home entertainment system is not only filthy posh, it’s actually quite a bargain for US $6 million. The picture elements alone are composed of a Sony SRX-S110 Professional Video Projector with a 4,096-by-2,160 resolution and the Stewart Snowmatte 1.0 Gain Laboratory-Grade Motion Picture Screen stands at a mammoth 18 x 10-foot which is nearly equivalent to an actual theater screen viewed from the balcony!"
