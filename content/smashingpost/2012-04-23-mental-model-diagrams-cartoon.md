We tend to carefully create our HTML and CSS, and meticulously place every pixel to our designs. We plan exactly where our content should be placed on a particular site. Among many other decisions we need to make, we always keep in mind to craft a great experience for all our users. But how do we know what our users really want?

One way is to understand the motivations that drive users in general. A <strong>mental model diagram</strong> can be created to do just that—to dive deeper and discover what users are trying to accomplish, and then create solutions that match.</p>
