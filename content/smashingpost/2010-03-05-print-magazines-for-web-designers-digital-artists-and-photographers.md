Although much valuable information for all sorts of web and print professionals can be found online, it is often difficult to weed through all the noise and find good quality content. I believe it's vital that professionals in different creative fields supplement their online learning and research through well-edited and <strong>high-quality print publications</strong>.

Print magazines, more often than not, are well-researched and are headed by top-notch editorial staff, usually containing information and resources on the cutting edge of their respective industries' trends and happenings.

To that end, to help you fulfill part of your offline research needs, I've compiled a list of <strong>print magazines</strong> that are of interest to professionals in three different categories: Web Designers, Digital Artists, and Photographers. And be sure to comment so you can tell us your personal favourite print magazine, if you don't see it listed here.

### Photo Technique

<em>Photo Technique</em> philosophy is that the photographic medium has never existed on the basis of unrelated techniques or unskilled aesthetics. For that reason, they incorporate the technology and methodology used in creating photographs into two categories. The first is a series of portfolio/article combinations that demonstrate both the means and the end result. The second is expanded technical articles intended to completely follow a process in detail, rather than offer short snip-its or tips. The magazine will never address the interest of a point-and-shoot mentality; the intent is to elevate the magazine to a more professional level.
