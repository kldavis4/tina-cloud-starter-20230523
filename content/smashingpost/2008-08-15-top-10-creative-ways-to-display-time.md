Clocks don't have to be boring. Of course, clocks need need to remain usable and display current time; however, they can do it in a number of creative ways. You are about to see some of the most creative examples out there. Take some <em>time</em> and enjoy. 

1. Uniqlock

<a title="UniqClock" href="https://www.uniqlo.jp/uniqlock/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0e64da4e-f902-4cc8-80f4-ba08defdff95/uniqlock3.jpg" alt="Uniqlock" width="499 height=" /></a>

What shall I say. If the others are songs, <a href="https://www.uniqlo.jp/uniqlock/" rel="nofollow">Uniqlock</a> is the concert. Japanese girls dance focusing your attention away from the passing time. Probably one of the strangest — unique — clock screensavers out there.

2. Word Clock

<a title="Word Clock" href="https://www.simonheys.com/wordclock/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/1908109f-28b7-44a9-a440-aff86fc7d468/wordclock.png" alt="Word Clock" width="480" /></a>

Whether you hate or love Helvetica, you'll just love <a href="https://www.simonheys.com/wordclock/" rel="nofollow">Word Clock</a> (for you haters out there the typeface can be changed). <a href="https://www.simonheys.com" rel="nofollow">Simon Heys</a>, the creative director of Tonic, definitely deserves the place on the podium with this stunning piece. You can download the screensaver (PC and Mac) as well as an iPhone application.</p>

3. DropClock

<a title="DropClock" href="https://scr.sc/products/dropclock/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ba52745a-7f28-4395-8b4a-a046d1e6742b/dropclock.png" alt="DropClock" width="480" /></a>

<a href="https://scr.sc/products/dropclock/" rel="nofollow">DropClock</a> is an aesthetically intriguing motion clock screensaver. Every minute of real time is numerically expressed with heavy helvetica dropping into water in super slow-motion. An impressive piece of art by Yugop. You can get the screensaver <a href="https://scr.sc/products/dropclock/" rel="nofollow">here</a> (PC and Mac, price: $15).

4. Uncontrol Clock

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/aee63f77-bf6e-4fcd-8b01-b6ae9fc80604/uncontrolclock.png" alt="Uncontrol Clock width=" height="235" />

Among other things Uncontrol Website offers the so-called "55 clock" for free download. This clock uses the 3rd dimension to combine an analogue display with a digital clock display. Ingenious.

5. FedEx "Just in time"

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/b3f33fd7-6d3f-4ea1-98a6-3c34f4a6487d/fedex.jpg" alt="Just in time" width="480" height="202" />

Just in time is the message of this advertising banner for FedEx, which won a Gold Lion in the Cyber Lions category in Cannes 2005. And deservedly so. You get the message.

6. Pulse Clock

<a title="Pulse Clock"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/78969348-0716-44a0-a9df-f28170fbe6e3/pulseclock.png" alt="Pulse Clock" width="480" /></a>

This neat little Actionscript Experiment by Mrdoob currently rocking at <a href="https://hi-res.net/" rel="nofollow">HiReS!</a> convinces through simplicity and aesthetics. Built using Papervision3D to experiment with real-time shadows.

7. Humanclock

<a title="Humanclock" href="https://www.humanclock.com/clock.php"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/856a32c4-49c3-48bd-b01c-c67fc2ce57a6/humanclock-1.png" alt="Humanclock" width="480" /></a>

<a href="https://www.humanclock.com/clock.php" rel="nofollow">Humanclock</a> is a project by Craig D. Giffen. People from all over the world submit pictures with certain times on them. Every minute there is a new picture telling the current time. Simple as that. Read the <a href="https://www.humanclock.com" rel="nofollow">project page</a> for more info (you'll find an analogue version, too).

8. Industrial Clock

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7c21b5cd-ec83-42dd-8ba0-cdd3a52f9729/industrialclock.png" alt="Industriafigure Clock" width="480" />Way back in 2000 the design legend Yugo Nakamura aka Yugop amazed the community with his Industrial Clock. It is not exaggerated to say that this piece has created a whole new genre of "video clocks" and served many others as inspiration (as you can see in some other examples).</p>

## 9\. Grid-Based Clock

<figure><a title="Grid Based Clock"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e91c55c1-5998-44fa-a01d-4271b1bb32a1/gridbasedclock.png" alt="Grid Based Clock" width="480" /></a></figure>

This clock is built by Geoffroy Delobel and based on an idea by <a href="https://www.sleepatwork.com/" rel="nofollow">Sleepatwork</a>. The Grid Based Clock is a rather "constructivist" approach to display the time. Its elementary formal vocabulary makes a unique and unusual charm.</p>

## 10\. Clockr

<figure><a title="Clockr" href="https://www.quasimondo.com/clockr.php"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/3f747a03-f8d2-4c55-9c2b-dd4866f2cd8f/clockr.png" alt="Clockr" width="480" /></a></figure>

Mario Klingemann (aka Quasimondo) came up with this classic. <a href="https://www.quasimondo.com/clockr.php" rel="nofollow">Clockr</a> uses random digit images from Flickr to display the current time.Click on a number to change the image, double-click it to view the full image. Use the mouse wheel to cycle through (just give it some time if it doesn't display the images right away). You can download the screensaver <a href="https://quasimondo.com/clockr_screensaver.zip" rel="nofollow">here</a> (Win only).
