   At Smashing, we’ve been busy over the last few months. We’ve set up new workshops, redesigned our navigation, [refined performance](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/03/floating-labels-performance-lighthouse/) and improved accessibility. There are subtle UX changes coming in, and we’d love to share what we’ve been cooking.

Not many people know that the entire Smashing Family is a [very small team](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/about#the-smashing-team) with just 15 wonderful people working day-to-day on everything from magazine and books to front-end and design. At times it might feel like that’s quite a bit of work, but we do our best to be well-organized and be productive, while working (well, *mostly*) **100% remote** for almost a decade now.

In fact, we’ve been quite busy over the last few months. We’ve been running our online workshops, redesigned our navigation, refactored a number of components, refined performance and improved accessibility. There are more **subtle UX changes** coming in, and we’d love to share what we’ve been cooking. *Settle in.*

## Upcoming Online Workshops

We’ve run 40 workshops with 2.600 attendees so far, and we’ve [learned](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/10/how-we-run-smashing-online-workshops/) how to run a workshop where you, dear readers, learn best. So for the next months, we’ve set up a full schedule on **front-end and design**, from web performance to interface design. <a href="https://www.smashingconf.com/online-workshops/" style="font-weight:bold;">Jump to all workshops ↬</a>

No pre-recorded sessions, no big picture talks. Our online workshops take place **live and span multiple days** across weeks. They are split into **2.5h-sessions**, plus you’ll get all workshop video recordings, slides and a friendly Q&amp;A in every session. (Ah, you can save up to 25% off with a [Smashing Membership](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/membership/) &mdash; *just sayin’*!.)

## New Navigation (Beta Testing)

With so many articles on the site, finding the right articles can be difficult. So for the last weeks, we’ve been going through **3.500 articles** and manually refining and standardizing the underlying taxonomy of our posts. You might have been there as well: dealing with articles accommodated over 15 years wasn’t quite easy.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/category/accessibility/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/03dcee9b-9cee-4695-a1d2-994d6aefb926/smashing-screenshot.png" width="800" height="" sizes="100vw" caption="Meet the <a href='https://www.smashingmagazine.com/category/accessibility/'>new navigation on SmashingMag</a> &mdash; we’d love to hear your feedback <a href='https://www.twitter.com/smashingmag'>on Twitter</a>, of course!" alt="A screengrab of the Smashing Accessibilit category page made on April 15, 2021" >}}

<p>That was quite an exercise in patience and hard work &mdash; but now we are happy to roll out the new navigation, with important navigation options surfaced prominently across the entire site. Hopefully, you’ll find the new navigation (on the top of this page, too) more useful.</p>

<p>Please <strong>leave a comment</strong> if you spot any bugs, mistakes, or perhaps something important missing — we’ll do our best to fix it and deploy right away.</p>

## New Evergreen Guides (Beta Testing)

<p>We have also rolled out new article formats &mdash; <strong>evegreen guides</strong>. These are the articles with curated articles, tutorials, tools and resources that we keep updating regularly. There are a few more of those coming up, but they should be a reliable source of techniques and tools.</p>

<p>Here’s what we’ve published so far:</p>
