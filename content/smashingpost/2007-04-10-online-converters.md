  Online converters always come in handy. Once you need to perform some
  operation with your files, they can save your time achieving the same results
  online, **without installing some specific software**. In fact, there are many
  online tools, which convert formats, files and code snippets for free. Some of
  them are quite specific tools aimed for developers, but some are common
  "all-rounders", which manage to convert almost every format to a more popular
  one. Using them, you can generate .pdf-documents out of images, images out of
  texts or RSS-feeds out of web-sites. You can also convert any audio- and
  video-files immediately - the results can be received via e-mail.
