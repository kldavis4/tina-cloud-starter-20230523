  In May we announced the [Typographic Layout Design Contest](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/05/21/typographic-layout-design-contest-join-in-and-win/)
  that aimed to collect beautiful typographic (X)HTML+CSS-based layouts created by the design community and release them for free as a gift for the web design community.
categories:
  - Coding
  - Freebies
  - Layouts
  - CSS
---
The response was overwhelming and we really had a hard time going through the designs, analyzing them and deciding which templates deserve the awards. Unfortunately, many templates were just copies of the current designer's blog and some weren't related to typography at all. So in the end many templates didn't make it to this post.

However, we did receive a number of **brilliant typographic templates that we are happy to release for free** download and personal and commerical use as the gift for the web design community. We hope that these templates will help you to improve the quality of typography in your future designs!

"The Layout is following the rules of Grid-Based-Design and aesthetical and readable type. I also tried to make everything only with CSS. The Images have to be replaced - blank PSD-Files in different fitting sizes are also attached. I know you won't take this but it was a good chance to try out some things I always wanted to make - and I will go on with this."

"I hand-in a single-page template for blogs. The title for this work is Extreme Georgia. It is 100% Georgia-based, and I am aware that it is a bit old-school. However, the design itselft reflect back the concept that I want to bring, which is, content is the king. I took into account the colors, whitespaces, line-height, font-size and also the content width for this design.

It might look plain, but it can be customized easily, let's say, the color of the links, background image can be added later, and also the background colors. My work is heavily influenced by many designers, such as Jason Santa Maria, Jon Tangerine, Tim Van Damme, Khoi Vinh, and especially, the Georgia font which was designed by Matthew Carter. Without them, I wonder where could I be now in web design industry." Designed by Mohd Huzairy Mohd Rezuan from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

"A minimal blog theme inspired in the Swiss Style of Design: It features Arial/Helvetica, grids, a generous use of whitespace for better readability and a strong focus in typography. The idea was to design an universal Wordpress theme that's focused on content and images, with an invisible, yet sleek design. Authors can modify the header as they wish, including images or playing with typography as in the example. this layout was coded using EMs, so it doesn't break when you make text size changes in your browser. It's an elastic design." Designed by Rodrigo Galindez from Argentina.

"The idea behind the layout was to create something very simple, but very detailed and adaptable. Cufon is the driving force behind most of the type itself, even the body text, which means that it looks fantastic in all browsers - even ones which don't usually bother to anti-alias. The adaptable-ness of the theme comes from the way in which the css classes are constructed. They're designed to work together to form different boxes of text.

For example, the class="box small left" would create a box spanning 1 column, with a background image to support the heading tag, and float to the left. A variation would be class="big right" - which would create a box spanning 2 columns with no background image, float to the right, and eliminate any extra margins. This means that it's really easy to adapt and change the layout to suit your needs, a few examples of which are included!" Designed by [John O'Nolan](https://john.onolan.org) from United Kingdom.

"This was mostly motivated by my desire to play around a bit with @font-face, which I don't usually get to do. I stumbled upon a lovely imitation of Bembo at Font Squirrel and based a lot of the design off its italic (though it works fine with Georgia as well). I knew I wanted to try to do something very clean and restrained, and decided on a news blog--typography themed, of course--and went from there. I took inspiration from a number of places, most strongly from [typographica.org](https://www.typographica.org) (for the general page structure) and [https://weblog.cynosura.eu](https://weblog.cynosura.eu/) (for the top navigation)."

"The basic idea behind this site design was to create a visually stimulating layout with typography. Because the site is to be used as a template I chose to layout the type in Times New Roman. I feel that as of lately I see the web-based font Georgia being used a lot and Times New Roman seemed to be a little more unique and has a lighter, more sophisticated feel. Also, keeping in mind that the design was for a template, I decided to make the background and type a neutral color and then accented it with a bold red/orange color.

I thought this way people could switch up their bold color to whatever they would like for easy customization. Another common theme carried out throughout the site design is the horizontal line element. This element is used in the navigation, to help break up blocks of information, and to underline words or links. Overall the idea was to create a template with an overall typographic foundation that could be easily customizable and I believe this design successfully does that."

I know that there are missing comments numbers, but who on the Earth does need comments? Main colors are #fff, #cfcfcf, #c40000, #666, and #444\. Hope you like it. Yeah, and it's my first template."

"This theme is designed to be light-weight and flexible. It is based on a modified grid system. I believe it has potential for a number of types of websites. I've included the source .png file to make it easier for you to modify the color scheme as you see fit. No link-backs to my site are necessary, although I'd GREATLY appreciate if you'd email me a link to theme in action if you use it! Since it's designed to be flexible, feel free to modify it to your needs and let me know how it works out!  

I wanted to make my template light-weight and flexible. Standard HTML typography is used extensively to make it easy to edit, quick to load, and optimal for SEO. It's based off of a modified grid to allow many different uses. In addition, I have included a rough fireworks source file to make it easier for users to change the color scheme. The name, happy-go-try, is an anagram of "typography" and is supposed to represent the light-weight, light-hearted approach I took with this simple, but flexible design."

"I wanted a simple theme that would rely less on graphics, and more on color layout and type to let the content stand out. I chose the paper background to create texture. After choosing one from cgtexture.com, the texture reminded me of a paper made from elephant dung [called Elli Poo I think].

So then I thought of a line drawing motif for the generic logo. [hoping it would look letterpress..] The motif is another way of drawing ganesha, the elephant god. I hand drew ganesha using wacom graphire in Gimp app, on Mac OS X. I also hand drew the twitter bird directly on the tablet. I hand coded the files using text wrangler.

I kept the colors to a minimum [pink/black/white] to keep attention on the text. " Designed by Lakshmi Mareddy from India, presently in the US.

"My aim as a designer is to keep it clean and simple but with a twist. Unnecessary mouse clicks is the worst and objects which doesn’t add anything goes right out of the window, so for me, designing this template has been a real challenge. To keep it simple but still change focus, from the actual content on to the shell of the web site. Therefore, I had to break some of my own ground rules.

01\. One extra mouse click: In order to view the actual content you have to click at least two times, one to expand the category and one to go to the project page. I choose to do it this way because I wanted the user to get a overview when he/she enters the site and to give each project it’s own page to make permalinking easier and to give the project the right amount of focus.

Because the task was to focus on the typographic I choose to add some unnecessary typographic details, this to make the site feel more complete. Because of the focus on typography and the above mentioned unnecessary details and my Swedish design heritage I choose to tone down the colours and stick to just black and white. I’ve exclusively used arial as the font, in different sizes, upper and lower case, and in different kering. This because I wanted to stick with a web safe font, and this where also a challenge, to make a web safe font become interesting, to make it stand out.

I choose to make a wordpress template just because I think wordpress is a very powerful tool to use these days.

"Worldlines is a concept design for a News website. Mostly today's news is treated differently from that of yesterday. Whereas in reality, most news stories span across days. The format we have designed gives the user a sense of where today and today's stories, stand with respect to those of yesterday and so on, and at a glance.

The layout is designed so that it can be scanned and preview quickly. The color-coding and top navigation give the user control over what categories s/he wants to preview. The news items will be ordered according to importance and the stories published previously can be viewed by navigating to the particular date using the navigation at the bottom. And of course typography was our main focus area." Designed by [Harshad Kulkarni, Sarang Norway and Sandesh Halarnkar](https://www.harshadkulkarni.com) from Bangalore, India.

I just love the variation in grays & they are great for product site,. As it has the character (gray color ) strong presentation feel.

"As you can see my inspiration was to create a simple, adaptable template using only web safe fonts as I think there is a lot than can be done with them structurally and within css without always having to use other replacement techniques. I had hoped to port it into a wordpress theme (and still plan to) but didn't have time before this deadline.

I should also point out that although the XML file does produce validation errors these are from the Twitter and Flickr scripts (both are from the official sites) in the footer and not the template itself.." Designed by [Susan Pierce Sloan](https://www.theearlybird.co.uk).

"My goal was to create a blog page with lots of text but still having a good amount of white space. I was aiming for some kind of media blog directed to young adults. First I wanted to create an ajax interface dynamically fetching news from rss feeds and videos from vimeo. But as I saw the contest just a few days before deadline, I realized there was not enough time. I am planning on creating the javascript files later as an addon to the theme.

The text in the blog posts are done like in print for books; Justified text with the first paragraph not being indented, but the rest of the paragraphs has text-indentation. This is done instead of separating the text with line-spacing. The reader does not get interupted by recurring gaps in the text and gets a smooth reading as when reading books.

I have a lot of Ideas of how to improve this template, but there is just no time. Creation Time: Design 9h, CSS 9h, Total 18h." Designed by [Alexander Dahlberg](https://www.alexanderdahlberg.com) from Sweden.

"A special typographic template for businesses.  
My immediate thought upon hearing about this contest was how well a typographic website design could work for a small business. I've found from my experience that small business websites are usually text heavy but not really graphic oriented and don't have a need of bells and whistles like login systems, e-commerce, forums, etc. With that in mind, my goal was to create an interesting yet simple website design a small business could use while relying on text to really do the selling.

I also wanted the design to be easily modifiable to allow for just about any type of business, so the only really distinct elements are the logo, the image on the front page and the slight texture on the footer. In addition, I thought that many companies could use a place to show off their work, especially if they're service oriented- hence, the showcase section. I hope you like it!"
