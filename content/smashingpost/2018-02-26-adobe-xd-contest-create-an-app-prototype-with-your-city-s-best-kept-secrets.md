<p><em>(This article is kindly sponsored by Adobe.)</em> Every city has its hidden spots: the best place to see the sunset, a cozy coffee shop that makes excellent espresso, or that impressive building you won’t find in any guidebook. As a visitor, you might stumble across little gems like these by chance, but, well, no one knows a city’s secrets as well as the locals, right?</p>

<p>Now’s your opportunity to let fellow creatives see your city through <em>your</em> eyes — and to put your design skills to the test at the same time. Our friends at Adobe are launching the “<a href="https://adobe.ly/2EFygx7">Prototype your Creative City App</a>” contest. The idea: Use <a href="https://www.adobe.com/ie/products/xd.html?sdid=M3T3SXTW&mv=social&mv2=ownsoc">Adobe XD</a> to <strong>design an app prototype</strong> that helps others experience your city. Show them where you get your creative juices flowing, where you relax after a long day at work, or whatever else might spark your love for the place you live each day anew.</p>

<p>How you tackle the challenge, is up to you, there’s only one requirement: You must <strong>use at least five icons</strong> from one of three <a href="https://adobe.ly/2H89EeJ">exclusive XD icon kits</a> which Adobe released recently. Designed with a focus on well-made user experiences by award-winning design studio <a href="https://www.antonandirene.com/">Anton &amp; Irene</a>, legendary designer <a href="https://www.lancewyman.com/">Lance Wyman</a>, and the Swiss design group <a href="https://burodestruct.net/">B&uuml;ro Destruct</a>, the icons are bound to add that special something to your prototype.</p>

<p>The deadline is <strong>March 15th, 11:59 PM (CET)</strong>.</p>

## What You Can Win

<p>After the deadline has ended, a jury made up of the three icon kit designers and Adobe’s Michael Chaize will select the winners.</p>

### 1st Prize

<p>An <strong>all-expenses-paid trip</strong> to the leading creative conference <a href="https://max.adobe.com/">Adobe Max</a> in October 2018. Plus a one-year Adobe Creative Cloud subscription and 100 stock images.</p>

### Top 10 Prizes
