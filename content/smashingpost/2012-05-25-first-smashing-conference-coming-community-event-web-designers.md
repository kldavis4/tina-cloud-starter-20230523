## Speakers and Topics

If you've been following Smashing Magazine for a while, then you won't be surprised by the focus of the Smashing Conference. We're aiming to cover a wide variety of Web design topics, such as visual design, front- and back-end development, UX design, mobile, responsive design, the business aspects of running a website, as well as the intricate details of the designer and developer's workflows. We’re encouraging our dear speakers to share details on how they work, what tools they use, and what their design and coding process looks like. We're aiming for <strong>valuable, practical and inspiring talks</strong>.

We’ve handpicked all of the speakers to ensure the high quality of the event. So far, 10 out of 15 speakers are officially confirmed. Please note that the topics presented here are subject to change. <del>More details on the conference, speakers, talks and workshops are available on the conference's official website.</del>

So, this unique workshop — hosted by Andy Clarke, designer, author and speaker — puts the design back into responsive design. Andy will teach you how to design from the “content out,” instead of from the “canvas in.” He’ll demonstrate how to separate design from layout; and if you work with designs made in Photoshop, he’ll show how to deconstruct a design into its components (color, texture and typography) before reassembling it for a fluid continuum of devices, from phones to desktops and everything in between.</td>
