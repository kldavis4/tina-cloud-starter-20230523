  **Free icons** are always great to spice up our work with minimal effort.
  Today, we're happy to release a **free set of 40 sports icons** in four styles
  and six formats. Each icon in this set comes in four styles: flat colored,
  glyph, Google material palette, and line strokes. Additionally, the line icons
  morph into four responsive sizes, comprising a unique icon at every
  breakpoint. That way, details adjust according to size while preserving the
  icons’ style and identity.

  All icons are included in **six formats**: AI, PSD, SVG, PNG, CSH and Sketch.
  We’ve optimized the SVG format, producing really light and small-size files
  that will enhance your websites’ and applications’ performance. Additionally,
  it makes creating web fonts a lot easier. The set is still in its infancy with
  plenty more icons currently in production. It's licensed under a **Creative
  Commons** Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.

### Insights From The Designer

<blockquote>"With responsive design thriving, the need for scalable iconography increases. After all, adaptability is key. Simply scaling an icon won’t do: details get lost during downsizing, lines disconnect or overlap, and minimalistic icons don’t always suffice when enlarged. We decided to create an extensive library of responsive icons, or in other words, <strong>icons that adapt</strong>. Whether your design needs detailed flat-style icons, glyphs or simple line strokes of any size, we’ve got them all."</blockquote>

We sincerely thank <a href="https://twitter.com/flatroundicons">Ramy Wafaa</a> for the design — we appreciate your time and effort, and please do keep up the brilliant work.</p>
