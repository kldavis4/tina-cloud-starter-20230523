  While recording artists and bands are busy recording their albums, a separate effort is usually being made behind the scenes to plan for the launch,
  promotion and circulation of the new tracks. The creation of **CD cover art** is an intergral part of this process.

Some CD covers feature heavily edited and airbrushed vanity photos of the musicians or recording artists. Thankfully, others are much more creative and work to create a cover image that reflects the mood, attitude or feel of the music it promotes. The <strong>most striking designs</strong> are those that capture both a buyer's attention and the essense of the music.</p>

The CD cover art designs and concepts featured in this showcase present dramatic, quirky, unusual or unique artwork. This type of cover art can make a big difference when a little-known band releases an album. Captivating or iconic cover art can make a band instantly recognizable, which increases sales, which in turn boosts airplay and subsequently demand for the music. Mainstream marketing is rarely this attractive, and the wide variety of <strong>beautiful CD cover art</strong> makes browsing CDs an enjoyable experience that reaches far beyond the music.

It must be noted that a collection of this nature is never complete, and the value of art is very personal and subjective. While we may love the familiar cover art of some classic favourites because we love the bands and the music, a critical look at the cover art can often be a disappointment. For the purposes of this cross-section of remarkable and obscure cd cover art we have chosen to ignore the musical genius of the albums in favor of showcasing brilliant cover art.</p>

## 100 Obscure and Remarkable CD Covers

Rush - Power Windows (1985)
This strange cover seems to be showing a mirrored world, where we sit and watch a window, surrounded by televisions.

Osaka Popstar - Rock'em O-Sock'em Live! (2008)
This gruesome cover is meant to be humorous, but may err on the side of bizarre. What look to be dollish little men have lost their heads, and perhaps some sales opportunities as well.

Neutral Milk Hotel - The Aeroplane Over The Sea (1998)
Vintage-looking and abstract, this beautiful coverart begs for an explaination.

Tool - Ænima (1996)
One of many brilliant cover art designs for Tool, this one is also a stunning optical illusion.

King Crimson - In the Court of the Crimson King (1969)
The street-art feel of this cover art is both comical and slightly unsettling.

Jerry Goodman - Ariel (1986)
Who doesn't love flying fish? This cover art is confusing without being annoying. Someone might pick up this CD just to try to figure out what is going on with the cover.

Daydreamer - Dialogue (2008)
Bold slpashes of gold and red are used on this cd cover, which features a clever typography image. Haunting eyes peek out from beyond a mass of golden words that serve as hair.

The Mars Volta - Frances the Mute (2005)

Pixies - Doolittle (1990)
With a name like Pixies, you might expect sweet, innocent looking cover art. This is not the case.

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/51cab7a8-0ad5-48a2-97e8-311aa5ec1bc4/pixiesdoolittle.jpg" alt="Pixies - Doolittle" width="500" height="503" border="0" /></figure>

Mimo - Hello Let's Be Friends
Like a trainwreck, it may be hard to look away from this cover. An alien-esque creature would like to be your friend. Would you pass it up?

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/06569ee7-de1f-4702-bc15-760d1d90fba6/mimo.jpg" alt="Mimo - Hello Let's Be Friends" width="500" height="632" border="0" /></figure>

The Roots - Things Fall Apart (1999)
This album was released with five different covers, each depicting a social disaster. The most striking of the five, seen here, shows African American teenagers being chased down a street in Brooklyn during the Civil Rights era.

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/3c4256c3-7e5a-4c99-848f-c074e1d60099/rootsthingsfallapart.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="500" height="498" border="0" /></figure>

Rivermaya - Buhay (2008)
The art on this cd cover is a bit perplexing. The mostly monochromatic design comes to life with a pop of red and yellow. As the eye is drawn into the picture, the oddities become evident.

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/66f5fc2d-f2be-4c99-9886-54fab5f708ab/rivermaya.jpg" alt="Rivermaya - Buhay" width="500" height="498" border="0" /></figure>

Story of the Year - Page Avenue (2003)

The Mothers of Invention - Weasels Ripped My Flesh (1988)

Matt Elliott - Howling Songs (2008)
This strange, scary and truly original cover captures attenton and perfectly reflect the music's essence (experimental rock and folk).

Circa Survive - On Letting Go (2007)
Two years later, Circa Survive released a new album with this cover, which seems caught between a dream and a nightmare

Black Light Burns - Cruel Melody (2007)
Taking a more classical route on this cover art, Black Light Burns manages to catch a browser's eye.

KMFDM - Hau Ruck (2005)
Harsh, abrupt, and loud, this KMFDM cover art gets in your face.

The Beatles - Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967)
Some say no collection of cover art is worth mentioning without this cover.

As Cities Burn - Hell or High Water (2008)
Both Hell <em>and</em> high water make their appearance in this album cover by As Cities Burn, and the heavy relief styling mated with macabre humor do well to quickly catch your eye.

Bring Me the Horizon - Count Your Blessings (2006)
Good photographic composition draws the viewer's eye to the little girl immediately in this cover from Bring Me the Horizon, only to then take it on a tour all over the picture.

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/images/100-obscure-remarkable-cd-covers/bring me the horizon - count your blessings 2006.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500" /></figure>

Deftones - Deftones (2003)
Relaxed and friendly typography tops this self-titled album's cover art, while perfectly over-contrasted colors surround the skull in the center. This cover stands out anywhere.

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/images/100-obscure-remarkable-cd-covers/deftones - deftones 2003.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500" /></figure>

Massive Attack - Mezzanine (1998)
The idea of such a limited color scheme and so much white space may seem boring on paper, but the execution of this album's cover art was flawless and the image has been burned to memory for millions of fans world-wide ever since.

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/cf475f64-399e-4da9-9e36-c5328c003332/massive-attack-mezzanine-1998.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500" /></figure>

Frank Zappa - Ship Arriving Too Late to Save a Drowning Witch (1995)
This cover combines a silly title with a Swedish-looking font and an imaginatively simple drawing that, once we've read the title, really does look like a drowning witch and a ship's keel.

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/images/100-obscure-remarkable-cd-covers/Ship_Arriving_Too_Late_To_Save_A_Drowning_Witch 1995.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="503" /></figure>

Toad the Wet Sprocket - Coil (1997)
This album cover, while very full of activity, manages to pull off a gorgeous, monochromatic glow that draws the reader in from the start.

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/images/100-obscure-remarkable-cd-covers/toad the wet sprocket - coil 1997.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500" /></figure>

The Rippingtons - Modern Art (2009)
While the typography on this cd cover could be much better, the "cool cat" and his art seem to make up for it.

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/3261b9b5-3729-4068-ade7-c0cae4431157/rippingtons.jpg" alt="The Rippingtons - Modern Art" width="500" height="500" border="0" /></figure>

The Van Buren Regulars - 14 Minutes 'till 3 (2007)
Beautiful lighting and a good setting make the photograph in this cover art perfect for what it's been used for. The title of the album serves as a seat to the band-name and the reader feels relaxed, as though peering over the railing and looking down the stairwell like a child might.

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/images/100-obscure-remarkable-cd-covers/the van buren regulars - 14 minutes til 3 -2007.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500" /></figure>

Norma Jean - O God the Aftermath (2005)
Like viral marketing, Norma Jean's album is made to stop a browser in their tracks and force them to wonder what happened on the cover. Did somebody write on it? Is this a used cd? This kind of extended attention is exactly what album art should get.

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/images/100-obscure-remarkable-cd-covers/norma jean - o god the aftermath 2005.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500" /></figure>

Green Day - 21st Century Breakdown (2009)
Warm and grungy, this cd cover art also captures a tinge of teenage angst.

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4ba81911-1bdc-4ea8-a58b-bba842d424ee/greenday.jpg" alt="Green Day - 21st Century Breakdown" width="500" height="500" border="0" /></figure>

Lemon Jelly - Lost Horizons (2002)
Looking for a lost horizon is exactly what the viewer winds up doing when looking at this album cover, due to the flow given it by the artist.

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8a1120de-4e1d-4954-a302-74aab65b12ee/lemonjelly-losthorizons-2002.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500" /></figure>

Out of Enemies - Into the Darkness (2009)
Good use of artist rendering here shows a surrealistic scene in modern manga-style illustration. We don't know what's in the woods, or why the hero needs to enter. We just know he's Out of Enemies.

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/images/100-obscure-remarkable-cd-covers/out of enemies - into the darkness 2009.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="495" /></figure>

The Flaming Lips - Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots (1988)
This cd cover art is unique and interesting, and with a pink robot, how could they lose?

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/6b61bb9f-f750-47dd-9fc1-2651b1e9d99d/pinkrobots.jpg" alt="New Order - Blue Monday" width="500" height="500" border="0" /></figure>

Adagio - Archangels in Black (2009)
Dark and moody, this cover art composition was designed to highlight key features. Mystery and anquish draw the listener to this cover.

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d4f521cb-961b-4be6-9712-770edb9444a0/adagio.jpg" alt="Adagio - Archangels in Black" width="500" height="353" border="0" /></figure>

Sepultura - Roots (1996)
Hot colors with a tribal infusion decorate this cd cover. The disconnect between the head and neck make this image even more interesting.

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e268f3c5-f710-4584-a708-0eeb280d69a9/sepultura.jpg" alt="Sepultura - Roots" width="500" height="500" border="0" /></figure>

Junkyard - The Birthday Party (1982)
This cd cover art is macabre and humorous at the same time. There is a little bit of everything in the image, and with each look one might see something that went unnoticed before.

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/b688d195-a5ae-4224-9503-3d41ca976257/junkyard.jpg" alt="Junkyard - The Birthday Party" width="500" height="491" border="0" /></figure>

Caged
A budding artist created this image in hope that it would be used as cd cover art. It's frightening and striking at the same time. The two faces could represent may things and may make an excellent cover image for the right band..

Yeah Yeah Yeahs - Zero (single, 2009)
Some covers totally mess with your mind. This is one of them. The bright blue eye seems to be staring out from a pair of shiny red lips. This is an unexpected composition, to say the least, and has helped propel the Yeah Yeah Yeah's from unknown independents to household names.

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e65b9e21-4c37-4a84-977c-cb614eb83e13/zero.jpg" alt="Yeah Yeah Yeahs - Zero" width="500" height="445" border="0" /></figure>

Anew Revolution - Rise (2008)
This cd cover art is simple and basic, yet incredibly striking. The edges look charred already, while a hand holds a match in the foreground. While the overall color scheme is subdued, even cold, the flame is embellished to give the illusion of heat.

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/76f7addd-0487-4b05-b5fa-d008fae2c55a/rise.jpg" alt="Anew Revolution - Rise" width="500" height="494" border="0" /></figure>

Further Seems Forever - Hide Nothing (2004)
Matching the cover in metaphor to the name of the band is a common trick in album art, but the more abstract the band-name the more difficult it becomes to accomplish. This cover managed to do pretty well in its attempt.

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/images/100-obscure-remarkable-cd-covers/further seems forever - hide nothing 2004.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500" /></figure>

Beck - The Information (2006)
The album was issued with a blank sleeve and booklet and one of four different sheets of stickers for fans to make their own album art. Beck explained to Wired magazine he wanted no two copies of the CD cover to be the same: “The artwork is going to be customizable. The idea is to provide something that calls for interactivity.” However, because the unique album art concept was seen as a gimmick to bolster retail sales, The Information was deemed ineligible to enter the UK Albums Chart.

Sila - Imza (2008)
Normally a photo shoot of the artist winds up somewhat plain; Sila does things differently in this shot, as it barely looks real. The feathers reminds us more of a cinematic trailer for a fantasy movie or video game, the brightness draws us into the center where her eyes anchor the canvas.

Tool - 10,000 Days (2006)
While the cover itself is not amazing, it’s what Tool have done with the packaging that makes it worth a mention. Tool raised the bar with digipacks by including a set of stereoscope glasses to view the accompanying artwork.

The Yeah Yeah Yeah's - It's Blitz (2009)
Doing what they do best, the Yeah Yeah Yeah's give another great example of how to turn heads. Upon seeing this, most everyone tends to stop and look.
