Coffee is one of the most popular drinks in the world. Millions, probably billions of people drink coffee every day: a shot of espresso, an indulgent caffè latte, the straight-up Americano, a fashionable flat white.

Creative folks have come to rely on a regular dose of caffeine, preferably delivered in one of coffee's varied forms. Many of us choose to work from or meet in a coffee house because of the cozy atmosphere, the smell of freshly ground coffee beans, the bustle of life – and the free Wi-Fi.

### Insights From The Designer

<blockquote>“It must have been mid December 2015 when I visited my regular coffee shop in central Cologne. A really small café named 'Hommage'. A place that is called a "coffeedral" because it looks like a mixture of a coffee shop and a church, including a church pew and a fresco on the ceiling. (Seriously, visit it on your next trip to this wonderful city!) Mo — who runs this lovely place with his fiancée Isa — and I got talking about our work and our love of coffee. We chatted about beans, roasts, grinds and filter techniques.

Talking to a barista like Mo opens up a great perspective. A true barista doesn't serve coffee. He creates art. Steaming hot art. Coming back home that day I took all the inspiration from that day and started drawing the first icon in what is now a huge icon set on the topic of coffee and coffee shops.

The set has now grown to 50 carefully crafted icons and I am more than happy to share it with the readers of Smashing Magazine – as I already have with a lot of my icon sets since 2009.

Enjoy these icons and remember: it's always coffee o'clock!

P.S. If you find an icon missing in this set, please don't hesitate to send an email to <a href="mailto:icons@pitsch.me">icons@pitsch.me</a></blockquote>

A big thank you to <a href="https://addictedtocoffee.de/">Oliver Pitsch</a> for designing this wonderful icon set — we sincerely appreciate your time and efforts!

Keep up the great work!
