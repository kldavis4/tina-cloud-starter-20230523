  To get better at your craft, there’s nothing more valuable as learning
  first-hand from the experience of others. What little tricks have helped
  fellow designers, design leaders, and developers become more efficient? And
  how do they overcome hurdles in their projects? Conferences are a brilliant
  opportunity to get up close with the pros and exchange tips and ideas. But
  they aren’t the only one.

  To spread expert knowledge between people who are hundreds, even thousands of
  miles apart, our friends at the full-stack UX design platform UXPin brought
  the first **free virtual summit** to life a few months ago. Now the second
  edition is on its way, and we are very happy to help make it happen: the Agile
  UX Virtual Summit, focusing on all things Agile UX. Because, well, we all know
  that building a UX team with agile organization can be quite a challenge.
