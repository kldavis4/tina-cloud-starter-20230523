As the Halloween is approaching, it's best time to spice up your design with some quick Halloweenish icons. And since we are, apparently, smashing and the Halloween is all about pumpkins, we decided to release <strong>Smashing Pumpkins: A Free Halloween Vector Icon Set</strong>. This set includes 14 exclusive Halloween icons (.png, up to 512Ã—512px) as well as vector sources (.ai CS3 file and .eps file), so you can modify and scale them as you wish. This set was created by Pien Duijverman from Netherlands, especially for Smashing Magazine and its readers.
