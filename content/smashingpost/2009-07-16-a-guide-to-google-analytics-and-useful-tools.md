<a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> is undoubtedly the most widely used web analytics application. Emerged from and based upon the analytics-package developed by Urchin Software Corporation (which was bought by Google in April 2005), the tool has become publicly available for free under the new flagship of Google Analytics. In May 2007 the application was heavily edited, developed and released; the design was simplified and more advanced featured were added.

You probably use Google Analytics on a regular basis, for basic stats tracking the performance of your site. And, just like most GA users, you probably very rarely venture far from the comfort of the reports shown on the dashboard. That’s all the analytical information you need, you may be thinking ... or is it?

Did you know that <strong>Google Analytics can generate up to 85 different reports</strong> that will help you analyze all possible data about your website traffic. It not only tracks visitors to your site or the number of page views, it can be used to see which content gets the most visits, time on site per visit, which ads are driving the most visitors to your site, it track the performances of your marketing campaigns, including AdWords, Adsense and emails and much, much more.

This post is not a be-all-and-end-all look at GA, but a rough guide to its many under-used features and reports. It is an easy to read guide that will help you understand and use the full power of Google Analytics. Honestly, it’s not that daunting.

## The GA Tracking Code

Google Analytics will only track pages that contain the Google Analytics tracking code, this is a small Javascript snippet that needs to be added to each page of your site, either manually or through the use of plugins or tool. You will find some tools and plugins to help you do this near the bottom of this post.

For a static webpage or if you want to manually install the code into your pages, copy and paste the code segment into the bottom of your content, immediately before the <em>body</em> tag of each page that you wish to track.

### To access your tracking code

*   Sign in to Google Analytics.
*   From the Analytics Settings page, find the profile for which you would like to retrieve the tracking code. Please note that tracking code is profile-specific.
*   From that profile's Settings column, click Edit.
*   At the top right of the Main Website Profile Information box, click Check Status.
*   Your tracking code can be copied and pasted from the text box in the Instructions for adding tracking section.</p>

## The Dashboard and Analytical Reports

Log into Google Analytics and you’ll arrive at dashboard, the central hub that gives you an overview of all the popular reports (visitors, content, traffic sources and the cool map overlay) generated by Google Analytics. You can customize this page by changing what reports are shown, as well as dragging and dropping the reports into a format that suits your needs.

## Analytics and Flash and Flex Content

One of the most common Google Analytic implementation challenges has been tracking Flash content. In the past, Flash tracking was not provided out of the box, and every implementation had to be tailored to each individual site, developers who tracked Flash had to create their own processes to get it working.

Google now provides easy to implement tracking libraries for both Flash and Flex, the libraries include: Flash visual component, Flash AS3 library, Flex MXML component and Flex AS3 library.
Download: <a href="https://code.google.com/p/gaforflash/downloads/list">Flash and Flex Analytics Tracking Libraries</a>.

## Analytics and Ecommerce

After you have enabled ecommerce transactions, Google Analytics will generate very detailed reports about every single transaction

<strong>Tracking Ecommerce with Google Analytics</strong>
By using Google Analytics with your Ecommerce website, you can gain valuable insights about your transactions, ROI, and customers.</p>

### Step-by-Step to enabling Ecommerce Reporting

The first step of tracking ecommerce transactions is to enable e-commerce reporting for your website's profile.

*   Log in to your account.
*   Click Edit next to the profile you'd like to enable.
*   On the Profile Settings page, click edit next to Main Website Profile Information.
*   Change the E-Commerce Website radio button from No to Yes.</p>

## Analytical Goals

As a simplified explanation, Goals are only a page view, nothing complicated about that. If you define a goal in Google Analytics, you are telling it what page view constitutes the completion of a Goal, and Analytics then tracks it. It is an easier way to generate the reports that you need as well as a great way to measure your business objectives.

<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=S5XpYm-B5Fs&amp;feature=player_embedded">How to create Google Analytics Conversion Goals</a>
In this video you will be shown how to create conversion goals in Google Analytics.</p>

### Step-by-Step to setting up Goals in Analytics

1.  Log in to your Google Analytics account at [https://www.google.com/analytics/](https://www.google.com/analytics/).
2.  Select the account that contains the profile you’ll be creating goals in from the **Overview** page.Find the profile for which you will be creating goals, and click 'Edit' under the 'Actions' column.
3.  Under the 'Conversion Goals and Funnel' section, select one of the four goal slots available for that profile and click 'Edit.'
4.  Turn the goal 'On' or 'Off.' If you choose 'On,' that means you want Google Analytics should track this conversion goal at this time. Since there are no ways of deleting goals, turning it 'Off' can make the goal inactive.
5.  Select from one of the three match types that Google Analytics uses to identify the goal.
6.  Enter the Request URI in the Goal URL box. Reaching this page marks a successful conversion. For example, a registration confirmation page, a checkout complete page, or a thank you page.
7.  Enter the 'Goal name' as it should appear in your Google Analytics account.
8.  If your goal URL is case sensitive, this means your goal URLs are capitalized exactly like the visited goal URLs.
9.  Enter the 'Goal value.'
