### Behind The Design

Here are some insights from the designer himself:
<blockquote>“Writing and editorial quality is essential to communicating a message. Even without an editor, any blog or website thrives on quality content just as much as, if not more than, a compelling design. With this in mind, we’ve decided to develop an icon set featuring some of today’s most trusted style guides.

Each crafted for its unique genre of writing, style guides help magazines, newspapers and websites keep their writing style structured and consistent for optimum readability. Use these icons to show your readers which style guide you use to maintain editorial quality or as a nice resource for a writing and editing website. Enjoy!”</blockquote>

Thank you, Thomas! We sincerely appreciate your work and your good intentions!
