Whether you’re a Web developer, Web designer or blogger, you’ve probably had to deal with the headache of converting many images to different sizes and formats. It’s not much fun if you have to convert all of them by hand. <strong>Batch image processing</strong> can reduce this process from hours of work to just a few simple clicks.

With batch image processing, you can specify a size or file type, and then a script runs to convert the images. You can process hundreds or thousands of images with just a few clicks. And nearly every image processor comes with a unique feature set.

## Types of Batch Processors

Batch image processors usually come with some very standard functions:

*   Resizing images,
*   Scaling images,
*   Converting to different image formats.

Some image processors also perform some advanced functionality, such as graphic editing (rotating, blurring, borders, adding watermarks), and some can even <strong>create slideshows</strong>, display other types of multimedia and perform other advanced functions.

Image processors are worth their weight in gold if you’re a designer or developer spending a good chunk of time converting images by hand in Photoshop. Let's take a look at <strong>15 useful batch image processors for both Mac and PC</strong>.</p>

## Use Photoshop CS3 to Batch Convert Images

Adobe Photoshop is far and away the most popular image processor for designers, so some might prefer the option of using the native tools provided by Photoshop. <strong>Photoshop comes with many advanced features, and one of them is the ability to batch convert image files</strong>. According to the <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop.html">Photoshop documentation</a>, it’s as simple as choosing either:

*   File > Scripts > Image Processor (Photoshop) or
*   Tools > Photoshop > Image Processor (Bridge),

and then selecting the images or file that you want to convert. Once you’ve selected them, select a location where you would like to save the files, select the file types you’d like to convert to along with any other configuration options and click “Run.”

## Advanced Batch Converter (Win)

However, the plug-in is only intended to resize RGB images, not indexed images. The plug-in is licensed under the open-source GPL license.</p>

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0f68f0c0-1c97-42d9-bfcd-1fb813774cdd/automator.jpg" alt="Automator" width="500" height="377" /></figure>

Automator essentially allows you to create tiny applications for specific purposes, and you can create one of these applications just for resizing images. eHow has an <a href="https://www.ehow.com/how_2101532_images-photo-editing-program-mac.html">excellent tutorial</a> on how to create an Automator action that resizes, names and saves your images to a folder, without having to open Photoshop.

## Sizerox (Mac)

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2991cc90-7946-45d3-84c6-81073c9993d4/sizerox.jpg" alt="Sizerox" width="500" height="345" /></figure>

With <a href="https://www.sizerox.com/">Sizerox</a> you can drag and drop images or folders into a simple graphical interface, and it will convert the images quickly and rename them if you’d like. You can use Sizerox to resize, rename, <strong>crop</strong>, rotate and watermark hundreds or thousands of images with a single Drag-and-Drop.

Sizerox uses Apple Quicktime to save the resized images, so the quality of the resized images is high. You can also use the Renamer engine to rename the images while resizing them. Because the software costs only $10, it won’t break the bank either. It’s simple, yet effective.</p>

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/19d2b5fa-cf65-4a77-bbe4-4de4235d5c78/quickscale.jpg" alt="Quickscale" width="500" height="409" /></figure>

<a href="https://www.codingmammoth.com/quickscale/">QuickScale</a> is another Mac-only application that is simple and easy to use. Like photo Drop, QuickScale has the ability to create “droplets” (saved resize presets). It may not have as many features as some other batch image processors, but it has all of the basics and has a short learning curve. It’s perfect for the user who only needs <strong>basic batch image processing functionality</strong>. A license for QuickScale costs $15.</p>
