This year, there will be 42 different sports and over 300 events taking place at the Olympics. Perhaps you have a project related to these upcoming games, or maybe you’ll be working on a project which is somehow related? Wouldn’t it be great to have a set of consistent icons for all sports-related activities, just in case? Well, that’s just what we thought.

### Insights From The Designers

<blockquote>"The Olympic games are scheduled to start on the 5th of August and we're making sure you’re prepared. No matter what country you are supporting this summer, we have icons to represent your favorite sports.

Our design team is very sporty themselves; one is a former soccer player and another one is a professional powerlifter, so they had a lot of fun creating these icons for you. Use them on your website or application, or just send them to a friend — it’s on us!"</blockquote>

A big thank you to Icons8 — we sincerely appreciate your time and efforts. Keep up the brilliant work!
