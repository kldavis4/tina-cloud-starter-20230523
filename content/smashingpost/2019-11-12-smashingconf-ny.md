We love running our event in New York, and given that it sold out a long way in advance we think that you do too. If you didn't manage to get a ticket, this post should give you a feel for what happened. We also have the video of the presentations to share with you.

Enjoy this roundup, and if you want to be there in person for one of our events next year, tickets are on sale right now!

## The Presentations

<p>The main focus of the conference is the speakers and the presentations they bring. As with all of our 2019 events, some speakers opted to present without slides.</p>

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/drewm/albums/72157711342495838/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/734455b5-4fce-4a36-ab4e-b53c5d457e66/ny-brad.jpg" sizes="100vw" caption="Brad Frost, Dan Mall, and Ian Frost co-presenting (Photo credit: <a href='https://drewm.photo'>Drew McLellan</a>)" alt="One person in the middle of the stage, two behind a desk" >}}

<p>In the tables below, I’ve linked to slides for those talks which had them, plus the video of each presentation. Enjoy two days worth of learning from the comfort of your own couch!</p>

### Day One

The [Day One Collaborative Doc](https://smashed.by/midtown) created by attendees is full of takeaways from the first day of the conference.

We then enjoyed talks covering a wide range of topics from our day two speakers.

## Workshops

Our workshops are a big part of each of our Smashing conferences. We held busy workshops the day before and day after SmashingConf New York, at the Microsoft Technology Center. Here is what attendees could choose from.

## Side Activities

A conference isn’t just about the talks and speakers. We want to make spaces where attendees and speakers can learn from each other and share experiences in a more informal setting. We want to offer something for everyone &mdash; from the party-goers to the fitness enthusiasts, and everyone in-between! So at lunchtime, we had lunch sessions: On Day 1, we saw the "Web We Want" panel discussion from Microsoft, and on Day 2, Deque ran a session for those who wanted to learn more about accessibility over a plate of lunch.

We also invited people who organize community meetups in the local area onstage to tell the audience about their group.

The SmashingConf run is becoming a fixture, and in New York we had Central Park to run around. We started just as it was getting light and joined the runners of New York for a lap of the park.

### Evening Events

The [Jam Session](https://smashingconf.com/ny-2019/jam-session) this time round was hosted by Shopify. Attendees spent time socializing and hearing some lightning talks from [Tiffany Tse](https://twitter.com/tiffany_tse), [Rachel Weil](https://www.twitter.com/partytimeHXLNT), [April Ellsey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aprilellsey/), [Timirah James](https://twitter.com/TimirahJ), [Jordan Patterson](https://twitter.com/jtjpatterson), and [Taylor Poulos](https://twp.io/).

We also had a party after day one which was held at The Waylon, where there were some nice craft beers and a lovely outdoor space to enjoy. Luckily the torrential rain didn't arrive until day 2!
