### Insights From The Designer:

<blockquote>“I love icons. Drawing with vectors makes me happy, gives me a lot of fun and lets me express my passion. Working on Vectors always gives me big satisfaction and pleasure. Icons remain the most high form to express the big in the small. Against hard lines, I always feel comfortable following natural hand movements when I draw in Illustrator, I really feel link I was drawing on the paper. And that’s the reason I will always draw this way.

Smashing Halloween Icons are a way to express something fun in a scary scenario, and the best way to do it is through Cartoon style. My favourite icons of this set? Devil and Dracula ones…I love thinking about Devil drinking a coffee and Dracula singing!"</blockquote>

A big <em>thank you</em> to <a href="https://manuelalangella.com/">Manuela Langella</a> for designing this wonderful icon set — we sincerely appreciate your time and efforts! Keep up the brilliant work!
