An intense debate was born when this citation was made by *Jeffrey Zeldman* himself. The question indeed is, “Should content always precede design?”

[A Richer Canvas - Mark Boulton](https://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/a-richer-canvas)  
On the Web, we usually have to abandon the notion of a page. Let’s look at this practically. To design a layout system for a website, we now have to consider many different variables.

[Media Queries - W3C Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/)  
A media query consists of a media type and a zero or more expressions that check for the conditions of particular media features. Among the other media features that can also be used in media queries are ‘width’, ‘height’ and ‘color’. By using media queries, presentations can be tailored to a specific range of output devices without changing the content itself.

[Media Query Bookmarklet - Rob Tarr](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/media_query_bookmarklet)  
One thing that quickly gets noticed when starting building responsive websites is that we constantly resize our browsers. We would resize the browser to the largest media query, and then step down and watch the changes so we know what media query we are looking at. This is not quite the best way to design a website.

The mobile context is being discussed at a great deal at the moment in regards to mobile Web. What does it mean? How can we use it? How can we make assumptions about the context a user is in, based on their device?
