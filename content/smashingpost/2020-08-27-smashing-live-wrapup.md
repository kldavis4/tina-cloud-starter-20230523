Last week, we ran our very first SmashingConf Live! event, the first in a series of online events taking us through to the end of 2020. We had an amazing two days and we hope that all of our speakers and attendees did too. In this post, I‚Äôll round up some of the key moments and feedback we‚Äôve had.

## A Team Spread Around The World

Here at Smashing, we take remote, distributed working to the extreme, and are very used to dealing with all of our different timezones. However, the conferences are the one time when most of us are together in one place. With all of us in our home locations and timezones, things were very different this time. We shared pictures of our setups in the Slack for the event, and lots of attendees joined in the fun and showed us how they were attending the conference themselves.

It takes a lot of people to bring you an online multi-track conference, so the full team taking care of everything and everyone behind the scenes on the day were:

- Andrea de Souza (*Volunteer*): Canada
- Amanda Annandale (*Head of Events*): Bristol, UK
- Bash Choudhry (*Volunteer*): USA

- Charis Rooda (*Marketing Coordinator*): Hong Kong
- Esther Fern√°ndez (*Partnerships Coordinator*): Barcelona, Spain
- Jan Constantin (*Smashing Team*): Freiburg, Germany
- Jarijn Nijkamp (*Membership Lead*): Hong Kong
- Marc Thiele (*Board Member*): Dusseldorf, Germany
- Mariona Ciller (*Partnerships Manager*): Barcelona, Spain

- Ricardo Gimenes (*Illustrator*): Malm√∂, Sweden
- Vitaly Friedman (*Co-Founder*): Dusseldorf, Germany

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Really enjoyed the first day of <a href="https://twitter.com/smashingconf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@smashingconf</a> live today. Especially the side tracks really made the experience for me.<br><br>There you had the chance to ask questions, engage in discussions, enjoy the chats. Very immersive and engaging and definitely a highlight.</p>&mdash; Stefan Baumgartner (@ddprrt) <a href="https://twitter.com/ddprrt/status/1296550326967898112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2020</a></blockquote>

## Our Conference Platform

When selecting a conference platform it was important to us to have something that would enable the <strong>fun and interactivity</strong> of an in-person SmashingConf. We wanted to have sidetracks, games, places to ask questions of our speakers, all along with main stage content. While we use Zoom for workshops, we didn‚Äôt feel that asking you all to sit through two days of Zoom meetings would be very Smashing at all.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://vimeo.com/449299198" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/187b1ebc-e4bb-47ee-b398-553905799863/live-platform.png" sizes="100vw" caption="We're running our conferences on Hopin, a friendly, inclusive platform, with Smashing branding and plenty of cats. With interactive, live sessions and live captioning. <a href='https://vimeo.com/449299198'>Watch a video preview</a>. (<a href='https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/187b1ebc-e4bb-47ee-b398-553905799863/live-platform.png'>Large preview</a>)" alt="The platform mid-session" >}}

Amanda and the rest of the team looked at a number of options and we ultimately chose to use Hopin. We trialed the platform for our Smashing Meets events, but this was the first time we would be running at such a scale. Everything worked really well, and speakers and attendees seemed to like the setup. As a speaker, I found it felt far more interactive than the usual online conference solutions, and less like I was presenting to my office wall!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">100% agree, Paul. It‚Äôs a fantastic setup, and the moderation and flow just WORKS! Well done <a href="https://twitter.com/smashingmag?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@smashingmag</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/smashingconf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@smashingconf</a> team! <a href="https://t.co/Xy9BKgyVTx">https://t.co/Xy9BKgyVTx</a></p>&mdash; Trine Falbe (@trinefalbe) <a href="https://twitter.com/trinefalbe/status/1296488077809143810?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2020</a></blockquote>

## A Lot Of Fun, And A Lot Of Learning

With multiple sessions happening at once we had [a lot of speakers](https://smashingconf.com/live/#speakers) sharing their knowledge with us. As with our in-person events, everyone created shared Google Docs of takeaways over the two days &mdash; [Day One](https://smashed.by/whisker), [Day Two](https://smashed.by/paw). MC Phil Hawksworth kept everything on track on the main stage.

Some amazing sketchnotes were created by [Ximena](https://twitter.com/ximenavf9) which give you a snapshot of the key takeaways from many of the talks and sessions.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I think this may be the last of the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/sketchnotes?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#sketchnotes</a> maybe. <br><br>GREAT TALK at <a href="https://twitter.com/smashingconf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@smashingconf</a> from dina Amin. Beautiful story and Stop Motion creations with a few other thinkery things üòâüíô<br><br>‚ÄúHow big is your fishbowl?‚Äù<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/smashingConf?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#smashingConf</a> <a href="https://t.co/FMIJFbYuWg">pic.twitter.com/FMIJFbYuWg</a></p>&mdash; Ximena Vf. (@ximenavf92) <a href="https://twitter.com/ximenavf92/status/1296929087219535872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2020</a></blockquote>

We even had our conference DJ Tobi playing some tunes between the mainstage talks &mdash; just like at our in-person events.

## Badges

We felt that a virtual conference should have badges too. So, for SmashingConf Live we had badges featuring a variety of cats. Attendees tried to find all of the different cats &mdash; all 96 of them!

It really did feel like an event, rather than a webinar, and it was great to see so many people &mdash; and to meet their cats! That‚Äôs something we don‚Äôt get to do at our usual events.
