The <em>Art Professions Icons</em> set would not be out of place in an artist's portfolio website, be they cook or painter — or even multi-talented. Imagine these icons guiding a modern art gallery's visitor through the institution's online presence and you won't feel let down. Any site remotely representing artistic efforts, finally, has a homogenous set at its disposal. Furthermore, the geniuses at BanzaiTokio did Smashing Magazine the honor of designing an icon just for us, which you will also find below.

You are free to distribute, transform, fiddle with and build them into your work, even commercially. Please always credit the original designer of the set. The icons may not be resold, sub-licensed, rented, transferred or otherwise made available for use.</p>

### Behind The Design

As always, here are some insights from the designers:
<blockquote>"We see a lot of icons created for business and general public - social networking and ecommerce, what bothered us is that fellow creatives - writers, painters, sculptors and many others were overlooked and we made it our goal to create icons for every creative activity there is.

Now artists can use these icons to showcase different sections of their portfolio websites and blog writers can have a complete coverage of all creative activities."

Thanks, BanzaiTokio, for being creative for the creative community!
