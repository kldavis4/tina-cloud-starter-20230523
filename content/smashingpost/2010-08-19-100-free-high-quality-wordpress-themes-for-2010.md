  It's hard to believe that a year has passed since our last WordPress theme
  collection, but there you have it — the time has come again. Once a year we
  feature the most useful and interesting WordPress-themes that we are
  collecting over months and present them in a nice quick overview. The
  collections from
  [2007](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/02/09/83-beautiful-wordpress-themes-you-probably-havent-seen/),

  and [last
  year](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/05/18/100-amazing-free-wordpress-themes-for-2009/)
  are still useful, but some of the themes are outdated or updated now.

Today, we present a fresh collection of useful WordPress themes. Please notice that some themes are a bit older, but they are included because we haven't featured them last time. This round-up picks up where we left off last year: most <strong>themes below were released between June 2009 and August 2010</strong>. We've also split this collection into the following categories: gallery and portfolio themes, themes for bloggers, e-Commerce WordPress themes, clean themes, magazine-style themes, minimal themes, mobile themes; pre-launch themes; and finally “Themes That Take WordPress Beyond.”
