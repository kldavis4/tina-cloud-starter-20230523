  Design doesn’t scale as cleanly as engineering. It’s not enough that each
  element and page is consistent with each other — the much bigger challenge
  lies in **keeping the sum of the parts intact**, too. And accomplishing that
  with a lot of designers involved in the same project.

  If you’re working in a growing startup or a large corporation, you probably
  know the issues that come with this: The big-picture falls from view easily as
  everyone is focusing on the details they are responsible for, and conceptions
  about the vision of the design might be interpreted differently, too. What we
  need is a set of best practices to remove this friction and make the process
  smoother. A **strategy to scale design without hurting it**.

If you’re working in a growing startup or a large corporation, you probably know the issues that come with this: The big-picture falls from view easily as everyone is focusing on the details they are responsible for, and conceptions about the vision of the design might be interpreted differently, too. What we need is a set of best practices to remove this friction and make the process smoother. A **strategy to scale design without hurting it**.

That’s exactly what our friends at UXPin thought, too, when they were creating a new design systems platform. And since they didn’t find sufficient answers, they decided to tackle these questions in a **free, virtual “scaling” conference**: the [UX at Scale Virtual Summit 2017](https://www.uxpin.com/ux-at-scale-virtual-summit-2017/). And, well, you’re invited to it.</p>

## What’s The Virtual Summit About?

Four days, 14 live webinars. That’s the [UX at Scale Virtual Summit 2017](https://www.uxpin.com/ux-at-scale-virtual-summit-2017/) which UXPin will host from **October 3rd to 6th**. Throughout the four days, design leaders from Atlassian, Salesforce, Airbnb, GE Digital, IDEO, Google, ADP, Linkedin, and Shopify, to name a few, will share their best practices for scaling products and UX processes.

The event will tackle the issues that weigh heavily on the minds of design teams, but that usually stay under-addressed: How can collaboration in large teams succeed? How can we keep a product consistent even with a lot of people working on it? And how can we make documentation work? These are just a few of the topics that will be discussed along the way.

Sounds good? Well, you can **join the event for free from anywhere**. The webinars will take place from **9:00 AM to 3:00 PM (PDT)** each of the four days (see the schedule below for more details), and a virtual lobby will provide an opportunity to connect with fellow minds from across the globe — right from your office desk.</p>

## Schedule

Four days dedicated to getting scaling design right. If your schedule doesn’t allow you to make time for all of them, you can cherry-pick those webinars you’re most interested in, too, of course. Recordings will be sent to all registrants afterwards, so that you won’t miss out on anything. All times are PDT.</p>
