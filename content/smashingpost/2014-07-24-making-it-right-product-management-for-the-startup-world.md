You've seen this happen a thousand times. An organization struggles with a high level of internal enthusiasm and creative chaos that team leaders don't know how to handle any more. To bring order into projects, a new **product manager** is appointed, under huge expectation, and with unclear responsibilities and big goals defined within a very short timeframe. That's when things usually go south, resulting in failed projects, crushed teams and disappointed clients.

That's why we've teamed up with our author and friend Rian van der Merwe, a senior product manager with a sociology and UX background, to create **a new practical book to help product managers** in the digital space _manage projects effectively_ — the right way, with the right strategy, in the right time, with the right team. _Making It Right_ is a book about just that: what product management is, what it isn't, why it's important, and how to approach it strategically and meaningfully to get things done well.

## What The Book Is All About

In the startup world, success is defined by the quality and reach of the product. The main purpose of this book is to help product managers who work specifically with digital projects build better — less complex, more focused, less long-winded and more intelligent — products. By featuring lessons learned and warning signs from real-life projects, the book provides a structured framework for **strategic product management** to help product managers build the right products, at the right time, for the right people with just the right amount of process involved.

The book isn't concerned with abstract models and theoretical concepts. Based on ideas discovered in actual projects, it explains the roles and responsibilities of product managers in a fast, agile startup environment. It features the characteristics of successful product managers and also provides a framework and practical guidance for product planning and product execution. If your company has to address these issues or you're looking for a **hands-on book to guide you through product management**, this is the book for you.</p>

## The Structure Of The Book

The book's structure has **two main parts**: product planning; and product execution.

*   **Product planning** explains how to figure out what to build and when. You'll learn different ways to gather user needs, business needs, and technical needs. The section breaks down product discovery and looks at why it's important to define the problem before jumping to product solutions. You'll understand what goes into a strategic product plan, how to prioritize what problems to work on, and how to create effective, flexible roadmaps for product development.
*   **Product execution** gets into the nuts and bolts of shipping the product. You'll learn how to choose the right problem definition (_what problem are you trying to solve?_) and how to distinguish between functional and technical specifications (_how will the problem be solved?_). The section touches on user-centered design, lean UX and how to test product hypotheses through quick, lightweight prototypes.
*   Finally, the book provides advice on how to establish an **efficient working routine** with team members through the “build, iterate, QA, release” process, and explains how to measure the success of the solutions being built, and how to feed those findings back into the product roadmap.</p>

### This Is What You'll Learn From The Book

Let's be honest: _product manager_ is not the most inspiring job title, but it's a critical position for building a great product and shipping it in time. In fact, it's not something that everybody can do. Good product managers need expertise and specialized skills that have to be acquired and mastered first. You might not learn them all from this book, but you'll know exactly what you need and how to apply these skills strategically.

In _Getting It Right_, you'll learn:

1.  Roles, responsibilities, characteristics and common tasks of a good product manager,
2.  Where product management fits into an organization and why an **executive mandate** for PMs is a prerequisite for success,
3.  How to balance user needs, business needs, and technical needs in product discovery,
4.  How product discovery, product roadmaps, and **strategic product plans** frame the product's development,
5.  How to redefine business needs by eliminating bad revenue streams and pursuing good revenue streams,
6.  How to avoid, minimize, and **pay down technical debt** that places strain on your product,
7.  Why many products fail and what the warning signs for failures are,
8.  Why **minimum desirable products** might be better than _minimum viable products_,
9.  When prioritizing themes, not projects or features, can help businesses to improve the quality of the product (the Amazon approach),
10.  When **product roadmaps** fail, when they work well, and how to set up a good one without timelines and release dates,
11.  Tools, techniques, workflows, and strategies for building prototypes quickly with a "design studio" approach.
12.  **Practical guidelines and a checklist** on how product managers can effectively start working at a new company.</p>

## Author's Note

Finally, here are a few notes from Rian himself:

<blockquote><p>“The book came about because I saw a lot of people in organizations perform some of the activities that make up the role of product management. The problem is that very few people take a holistic view of the product, and this is not a role that should be split up into tiny pieces. So, you see marketing people doing some design and research, business analysts doing some spec writing, developers managing the product backlog, and so on.</p>

<p>All this without a person who is responsible for the <strong>overall vision, prioritization, and execution</strong> of the product. I want to provide a complete framework for product management that is agnostic to whatever development process people use (agile, etc.). This book is my humble attempt to do just that.”</p></blockquote>
