### Insights From The Designers:

<blockquote>"Ever since the launch of our first 1000 flat icons, we received great feedback which encouraged us to further refine the icons, add more features, provide more formats and most importantly, produce many new icons. <strong>It is a true challenge</strong> attempting to cover all subjects and actions while trying to keep the illustrations simple enough to work as “icons” — a challenge we love!

We've received requests for over 800 different icons and have now successfully produced 500 of them for our first update. New ideas keep arising, so bear with us and stay tuned!"</blockquote>

Thank you, dear <a href="https://roundicons.com/">Roundicons</a> team, for this fantastic icon set! We sincerely appreciate your time and efforts!
