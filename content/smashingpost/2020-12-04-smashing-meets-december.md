If you are missing your festive meetups this year or just fancy seeing some friendly faces and learning some new things join us on December 17th for another [Smashing Meets event](https://smashingconf.com/meets-holidays).

Tickets are only <strong>10 USD</strong> (and <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/membership/">free for our lovely Smashing Members</a>). The fun starts at 9AM ET (Eastern Time) or 15:00 CET (Central European Time) on the 17th December.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ok. This is important. Smashing Meets by <a href="https://twitter.com/smashingconf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@smashingconf</a> was soooo much fun. I will have to tune in whenever the timezone suits, it was an absolute blast!!!</p>&mdash; Mandy Michael (@Mandy_Kerr) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mandy_Kerr/status/1262759818080645121?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 19, 2020</a></blockquote> <script defer  src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This time, we will have talks from three speakers&mdash;[Adekunle Oduye](https://smashingconf.com/meets-holidays/speakers/adekunle-oduye/), [Ben Hong](https://smashingconf.com/meets-holidays/speakers/ben-hong/), and [Michelle Barker](https://smashingconf.com/meets-holidays/speakers/michelle-barker/). There will be an <strong>interface design challenge</strong> and chance to network and meet other attendees. Just like an in-person meetup but you wonâ€™t have to go out in the cold!

If you want to know more about how our Smashing Meets events work, we have [a review of a previous event](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/05/smashing-meets-live/), see [some of the videos](https://vimeo.com/search?q=smashing+meets), or just head on over to the [event page](https://smashingconf.com/meets-holidays) and get a ticket! I hope to see you there.
