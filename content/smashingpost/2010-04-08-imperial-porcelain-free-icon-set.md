### Behind the design

As always, here are some insights from the designer himself:
<blockquote>Icons were made in design of Russian imperial porcelain. We wished to perform this work with humour and in Russian traditions. The icon "partners" is especially distinguished. We tried to pay huge attention to difficult pictures and small details. The icons set is freely available for commercial and non-commercial use, without any restrictions. The set consists of 5 custom-made icons in the resolution 160×160 .png.</blockquote>

Thank you very much, Roman! We appreciate your efforts.
