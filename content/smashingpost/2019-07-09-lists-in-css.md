Lists in CSS have particular properties which give us the standard list styling we expect. An unordered list gains a list bullet, of the type `disc`, and ordered lists are numbered. My interest in exploring lists in more detail came from some work I did to document the `::marker` pseudo-element for MDN. This pseudo-element ships in Firefox 68 and is **being released today**. With the `::marker` pseudo element available to us, we can start to do some interesting things with lists, and in this article, I‚Äôll explain more.

## Deconstructing A List

You may not have thought much about lists, although we use them frequently in our markup. Many things can be marked up quite logically as a list. While step-by-step instructions or ranked elements may naturally be described by an ordered list `<ol>`, many things in a design can be described using an unordered list `<ul>`. A very common usage of the element, for example, is to mark up navigation, as it is a list of destinations on the site. For our exploration, let‚Äôs start by finding out exactly what a list is in CSS.

As with many things in CSS, lists have some initial values applied to them. These values make them look like a list. These special values begin with the information that a list item has the `display` property with a value of `list-item`. This creates a block-level box, with an additional marker box. The marker box is where the list bullet or number is added.

{{% feature-panel %}}

Lists were defined early on in CSS, and much of the definition of lists as we use them today is from CSS2. [The CSS2 specification describes a list item](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/generate.html#lists) as follows:

<blockquote>‚ÄúAn element with <code>display: list-item</code> generates a principal block box for the element‚Äôs content and, depending on the values of <code>list-style-type</code> and
<code>list-style-image</code>, possibly also a marker box as a visual indication that the element is a list item.‚Äù</blockquote>

The _principal block box_ is the main box of the element and contains all of the children as a list item can contain other markup. The marker box is then placed in respect to this principal box. The specification goes on to detail the fact that any background color will be only behind this principal box, and not the marker. Also that the marker can be set to one of a range of pre-defined values:

- `disc`
- `circle`
- `square`
- `decimal`
- `decimal-leading-zero`
- `lower-roman`
- `upper-roman`
- `lower-greek`
- `lower-latin`
- `upper-latin`
- `armenian`
- `georgian`
- `lower-alpha`
- `upper-alpha`
- `none`
- `inherit`

The Level 3 display specification [defines `display: list-item`](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-display/#list-items) along with the other possible values for the `display` property. It refers back to CSS 2.1 &mdash; as do many CSS properties and values which come from CSS2 &mdash; but describes the `list-item` keyword as, "causing the element to generate a `::marker` pseudo-element".

The Level 3 specification also introduces the ability to create an inline list item with the two value syntax being used `display: inline list-item`. This is as yet unimplemented by browsers.

## Creating Marker Boxes On Non-List Items

As with other values of `display`, it is perfectly valid to give any HTML element a display type of `list-item` (should you wish to generate a `::marker` pseudo-element on the item). This will not cause the element to _become_ a list item semantically, but instead it will only visually display as a list item, and therefore be able to have a `::marker`. When we discuss the `::marker` pseudo-element below, you will discover some cases where giving other elements `display: list-item` can be useful.

## The CSS Lists Level 3 Specification: `::marker` And Counters

The `display` specification expands and clarifies the definition of lists that we find in CSS2, however, there is also a specification which defines list behavior in detail: the [CSS Lists Specification Level 3](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-lists-3/). As the basic behavior of list items is defined in `display`, this specification details the marker box generated when something has `display: list-item` along with the counters which are used by default whenever you create an ordered list. There is some potentially useful functionality accessed via these features.

## The `::marker` Pseudo-Element

The `::marker` pseudo-element allows you to target the list marker &mdash; separately from the content of the list item. This was not possible in previous versions of CSS, therefore, if you changed the color or font size of the `ul` or `li`, this would also change the color and font size of the markers. In order to do something as seemingly simple as having different color list bullets than text, would involve either wrapping the content of the list item in a span (or using an image for the marker).

<pre><code class="language-css">ul {
  color: #00b7a8;
}

ul span {
  color #333;
}
</code></pre>

With the `::marker` pseudo element, the simplest thing you might want to try is having a different bullet to text color, which means that instead of the code in the example above you can use:

<pre><code class="language-css">ul {
    color: #333;
}

ul ::marker {
    color: #00b7a8;
}
</code></pre>

You might also want to use a different size and `font-family` for the numbering on an ordered list.

<pre><code class="language-css">ol ::marker {
  font-size: 200%;
  color: #00b7a8;
  font-family: "Comic Sans MS", cursive, sans-serif;
}
</code></pre>

You can see all of these in a supporting browser by using my CodePen example:

{{< codepen height="480" theme_id="light" slug_hash="VJQyoR" default_tab="result" breakout="true" user="rachelandrew" editable="true" data-editable="true" >}}See the Pen [Colored bullets with and without marker](https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/penVJQyoR) by <a href="https://codepen.io/rachelandrew">Rachel Andrew</a>.{{< /codepen >}}

You could use the `::marker` pseudo-element on non-list items. In the code below, I have set a heading to `display: list-item`. This gives it a bullet and therefore a `::marker` box to target.

I have changed the bullet to use an emoji:

<pre><code class="language-css">h1 {
  display: list-item;
}

h1::marker {
  content: "üê±";
}
</code></pre>

{{< rimg href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a7bcc3ac-b11a-498d-96f8-115c1a82cd74/firefox-heading-with-emoji.png" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a7bcc3ac-b11a-498d-96f8-115c1a82cd74/firefox-heading-with-emoji.png" sizes="100vw" caption="In Firefox, you can see the emoji used as a marker." alt=" Heading with a cat emoji to the left of it" >}}

{{< codepen height="480" theme_id="light" slug_hash="wLyyMG" default_tab="result" breakout="true" user="rachelandrew" editable="true" data-editable="true" >}}See the Pen [Heading and marker](https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/pen/wLyyMG) by <a href="https://codepen.io/rachelandrew">Rachel Andrew</a>.{{< /codepen >}}

In the above example, I have used generated content in the rules for the marker. Only a small subset of CSS properties is available for use on `::marker`. These include font properties and color, however, they also include the `content` property, for including generated content.

The addition of `content` as an allowed property for `::marker` is recent, however, it is included in the Firefox implementation. The inclusion means that you can do things like include a string of text in a `::marker`. It also raises additional possibilities for formatting of markers when you combine the use of counters with `::marker`.

### Browser Support And Fallbacks

For browsers that do not support the `::marker` pseudo-element, the fallback is the regular marker that would have been displayed anyway. Unfortunately, we can‚Äôt currently use Feature Queries to detect support for selectors such as this pseudo-element right now, although there has been [an issue raised](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/3207) about adding this to the specification. This means that you can‚Äôt fork your code to do one thing when you have support and something else if you do not. In most cases, falling back to the regular marker will be a reasonable solution.

## Counters

Ordered lists have list numbering &mdash; something which is achieved by way of a CSS Counter. The CSS Lists specification therefore also describes these counters. We can access and create counters ourselves which, combined with the `::marker` pseudo-element can give us some useful functionality. These counters can also be used in regular (non `::marker`) generated content.

If I have a numbered list of steps (and I would like to write out "Step 1", "Step 2", and so on), I can do this by using generated content in my marker and appending the `list-item` counter, this represents the built-in counter:

<pre><code class="language-css">::marker {
  content: "Step " counter(list-item) ": ";
}
</code></pre>

{{< rimg href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/51d7f1ba-b4d3-4431-b6ce-4e1d6b9e6ae9/firefox-content.png" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/51d7f1ba-b4d3-4431-b6ce-4e1d6b9e6ae9/firefox-content.png" sizes="100vw" caption="In Firefox, you will see the counter prefixed with the word ‚ÄúStep‚Äù." alt="An ordered list with Step 1, Step 2, and so on, before each list item" >}}

{{< codepen height="480" theme_id="light" slug_hash="BgRaoz" default_tab="result" breakout="true" user="rachelandrew" editable="true" data-editable="true" >}}See the Pen [Counters and marker](https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/pen/BgRaoz) by <a href="https://codepen.io/rachelandrew">Rachel Andrew</a>.{{< /codepen >}}

### Nested Counters

If you have nested lists, a common way to number them is to have the top-level item a whole number, (1), then child items as (1.1, 1.2) and their children (1.1.1, 1.1.2), and so on. You can achieve this by using more functionality of counters.

When you nest HTML lists, you will end up with multiple counters of the same name &mdash; nested inside each other. The nest of counters can be accessed using the `counters()` function.

In the code below, I am using `counters()` to format my list markers as described above. The first argument for `counters()` is the name of the counter to use. I‚Äôm using the built-in `list-item` counter. The second argument is a string &mdash; this is what will be concatenated between output counters (I‚Äôm using a `.`). Finally, I add a `:` outside of the counter function but inside the value of `content` so that my counter output will be separated from the content by a colon.

<pre><code class="language-css">::marker {
  content: counters(list-item,'.') ':';
  color: #00b7a8;
  font-weight: bold;
}
</code></pre>

This gives me the output as in the image. If you are using a browser which supports `::marker` and counters, then you can see it working in the CodePen example &mdash; try changing the string from a `.` to something else to see how that changes the output.

{{< rimg href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/da79bf11-735d-47b5-aeab-9f9adca48d37/firefox-nested-counters.png" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/da79bf11-735d-47b5-aeab-9f9adca48d37/firefox-nested-counters.png" sizes="100vw" caption="In Firefox, you will see nested list numbering separated by dots." alt="A set of nested lists" >}}

{{< codepen height="480" theme_id="light" slug_hash="VJbwxL" default_tab="result" breakout="true" user="rachelandrew" editable="true" data-editable="true" >}}See the Pen [Nested counters](https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/pen/VJbwxL) by <a href="https://codepen.io/rachelandrew">Rachel Andrew</a>.{{< /codepen >}}

### What‚Äôs The Difference Between `counter()` And `counters()`?

The `counter()` function we used in the first example to write out our steps uses the innermost counter only. Therefore, in the situation where you have a set of nested lists, you will write out the counter which related to the level you are currently on.

The `counters()` function essentially writes out that whole branch and gives you the opportunity to concatenate a string between counters in the branch. So if you have a list item with a counter of `2` (which is part of a list nested inside a list item with a counter of `4`), then the branch contains:

- `4`
- `2`

You can output this as `4.2` in the marker by using:

<pre><code class="language-css">::marker {
  content: counters(list-item,'.');
}
</code></pre>

## Counters On Other Elements

Counters can be used on things which are not lists &mdash; either to output a marker &mdash; in which case the element will need to have `display: list-item` &mdash; or to output regular generated content. Counters are used extensively in book production, in order to enable chapter and figure numbering amount other things. There is no reason not to take a similar approach on the web, in particular for longer articles.

The CSS properties defined in the CSS Lists specification which deal with these counters are:

- `counter-set`
- `counter-reset`
- `counter-increment`

To see how these work outside of lists we can look at an example of using counters to number the headings in a document.

The first thing I need to do is to create a counter for headers on the body element &mdash; ready for use. I‚Äôm using the `counter-reset` property to do this. The `counter-reset` and `counter-set` properties are very similar. The `counter-reset` property will create a new counter if a counter of the specified name does not already exist, but will also create nested counters as described above if a counter of that name does exist. The `counter-set` property will only create a new counter if there is no counter of that name. For this, use either property would work just fine, however, `counter-set` does not have as good browser support as `counter-reset`, so I am taking the practical route:

<pre><code class="language-css">body {
  counter-reset: heading-counter;
}
</code></pre>

Now that I have a counter, I can then use the `counter-increment` property on the selector for the headers; this should increment the counter every time the selector matches.

<pre><code class="language-css">h2 {
  counter-increment: heading-counter;
}
</code></pre>

To see the value, I need to output it to the document. I can do this by using Generated Content and adding it `before` the heading as shown in the following CodePen example:

<pre><code class="language-css">h2::before {
  content: counter(heading-counter) ": ";
  color: #00b7a8;
  font-weight: bold;
}
</code></pre>

{{< codepen height="480" theme_id="light" slug_hash="gNGjxq" default_tab="result" breakout="true" user="rachelandrew" editable="true" data-editable="true" >}}See the Pen [Headings and counters](https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/pen/gNGjxq) by <a href="https://codepen.io/rachelandrew">Rachel Andrew</a>.{{< /codepen >}}

Alternatively, I could make the `h2` element into a `list-item` and then use `::marker`, as demonstrated below. As already detailed, using the `::marker` element has limited browser support. In Firefox, you should see the counter used as the marker for the heading, while other browsers will show the default bullet.

<pre><code class="language-css">h2 {
  display: list-item;
}

h2::marker {
  content: counter(heading-counter)  ": ";
  color: #00b7a8;
  font-weight: bold;
}
</code></pre>

{{< codepen height="480" theme_id="light" slug_hash="pXWZay" default_tab="result" breakout="true" user="rachelandrew" editable="true" data-editable="true" >}}See the Pen [Headings, markers, and counters](https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/pen/pXWZay) by <a href="https://codepen.io/rachelandrew">Rachel Andrew</a>.{{< /codepen >}}

### Counters On Form Elements

There is also a little bit of interactivity that you can achieve using CSS Counters &mdash; something that you might think you need JavaScript to do.

I have a form which has a number of required fields. The required status can be selected in CSS with a `:required` pseudo-class, and the fact that a field has not been completed can be detected by way of the `:invalid` pseudo class. This means that we can check for fields which are both required and invalid, and increment a counter. Then output that as generated content.

{{< codepen height="480" theme_id="light" slug_hash="vqpJdM" default_tab="result" breakout="true" user="rachelandrew" editable="true" data-editable="true" >}}See the Pen [Counting required form fields](https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/pen/vqpJdM) by <a href="https://codepen.io/rachelandrew">Rachel Andrew</a>.{{< /codepen >}}

How useful this is in reality is debatable &mdash; given that we can‚Äôt really do anything with that value other than stick it into generated content. There are also concerns with regard to generated content being inaccessible to certain screen readers, therefore any usage that is more than decorative would need to ensure other ways of accessing that information. Read, "[Accessibility Support For CSS Generated Content](https://tink.uk/accessibility-support-for-css-generated-content/)" and the more recent information, "[CSS Content Property Screen Reader Compatibility](https://www.powermapper.com/tests/screen-readers/content/css-generated-content/)" for more details regarding accessibility and generated content.

However, it demonstrates that counters can achieve more useful things than simply numbering lists. It may be that one day that knowledge does come in handy to solve some problem you are working on.
