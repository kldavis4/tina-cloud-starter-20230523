  If you build and develop Wordpress themes often, you will probably be fed up of all the repetitive code writing, the constantly checking of your mark-up and all you really want to do is focus on the design and the project-specific features. The answer is a Wordpress development framework.

A framework is designed to speed up the process of designing and coding a Wordpress theme by minimizing your time, and balancing your patience, on Wordpress’ back-end code that is repeated within every theme.</p>

This post is not about finding the best framework, it is about finding the right framework that works for you. If you are an experienced developer then you will probably go for the powerful and feature rich Thematic or Carrington, or if you are a novice, you could try the Whiteboard framework or , even easier, download a stripped out and bare bones blank canvas theme, which you will find at the bottom of the post.

Which would you use?

## Thematic - WP Framework

<a href="https://themeshaper.com/thematic/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/22cfc007-8cc5-4029-9303-e4feca593506/wpframework1.jpg" alt="Wordpress Framework" width="480" height="250" /></a>

<a href="https://themeshaper.com/thematic/">Thematic</a> is a highly polished WordPress Theme Framework that is built upon the 960.gs. At first glance, its backend may look daunting and complex, but you will soon realise just how well organised it is and easy to use. Its power is based upon its flexibility and its simple customisation, you would be very hard pushed to find a project you couldn't use the Thematic WP Framework for.

*   [Thematic Support Forums](https://themeshaper.com/forums/).
*   [Thematic Customisation Guide](https://themeshaper.com/thematic/guide/).</p>

### Thematic Features

*   Optional 2 or 3 column layouts.
*   Up to 13 widget ready areas.
*   Modular CSS with pre-packaged resets and basic typography.
*   Fully Search-Engine Optimized.
*   Can be used as it is, or as a blank WordPress theme.
*   Dynamic post and body classes make it a hyper-canvas for CSS artists.
*   Options for multi-author blogs.
*   Great support available from the customisation guide and forums.
*   Child Themes are available for upgrading the theme.</p>

### Thematic (child) Themes

Thematic uses Child Themes, these are essentially stripped down versions of a full WP theme, that needs the Thematic Framework for functionality. Upon download, Thematic comes packaged with a basic child theme, but you can download many more from the Thematic homepage. <a href="https://themeshaper.com/category/thematic-child-themes/">Download Thematic Child Themes</a>.

Below, you will find a small selection of themes available for Thematic.

Whiteboard will never be as powerful as the Carrington framework or the Buffet framework, it has been developed for simpler development requirements. Simply, it has been designed to speed up the process of designing and coding a Wordpress theme by eliminating the time spent on Wordpress’ back-end PHP that is repeatedly used in every theme. It is clean, noted, and very small, weighing in at 76kb, its amazingly compact.

## The WordPress Starter Theme Project

<a href="https://wpcandy.com/articles/the-wordpress-starter-theme-project.html"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a2dcae87-e918-43c9-94b7-65388dff1200/wpframework15.jpg" alt="Wordpress Framework" width="480" height="250" /></a>

Similar in idea as the Whiteboard framework, <a href="https://wpcandy.com/articles/the-wordpress-starter-theme-project.html">The Wordpress Starter Theme Project</a> was developed for those who hate repeatedly doing the same actions every time you start a new Wordpress project. This is a very easy to use framework, which is ideal for the novice to learn the basics of Wordpress structure.

## Ashford WP Framework

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4dcf8632-46a5-4cf5-a8ad-7b8c5381fd83/wpframework31.jpg" alt="Wordpress Framework" width="480" height="250" />

Ashford has been built to be as simple as possible to use, it is also packed with many useful and powerful features. You can create and edit content with Adminbar, Hints and Admin-In-Place, choose from dozens of page layouts (including a content carousel), content can also be customized using widgets and multiple sidebars and of course all code validates and is fully SEO.

Ashford, like most frameworks, uses child themes, making it even easier to develop with. Unfortunately, child themes for Ashford are as yet limited.

## Sandbox

<a href="https://www.plaintxt.org/themes/sandbox/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/05f2c7b0-6672-45f7-bd08-d0759c7f918d/wpframework16.jpg" alt="Wordpress Framework" width="480" height="250" /></a>

The seemigly ageless <a href="https://www.plaintxt.org/themes/sandbox/">Sandbox</a>, is a useful tool for WordPress theme designers and developers, it can be easily developed solely with CSS, so beginners will feel comfortable not having to worry about PHP. Experienced developers and designers can accomplish almost anything with minimal work, thanks to the rich, semantic markup and profusion of classes dynamically generated by the Sandbox.

The main feature of the Sandbox, and the feature that has made it very popular, is its markup. The class-generating functions included with the Sandbox create an extensible and semantic XHTML structure. Please note, the Sandbox has only been tested up to WP 2.6.

Similar in idea as the Whiteboard framework, <a href="https://wpcandy.com/articles/the-wordpress-starter-theme-project.html">The Wordpress Starter Theme Project</a> was developed for those who hate repeatedly doing the same actions every time you start a new Wordpress project. This is a very easy to use framework, which is ideal for the novice to learn the basics of Wordpress structure.

Ashford has been built to be as simple as possible to use, it is also packed with many useful and powerful features. You can create and edit content with Adminbar, Hints and Admin-In-Place, choose from dozens of page layouts (including a content carousel), content can also be customized using widgets and multiple sidebars and of course all code validates and is fully SEO.

Ashford, like most frameworks, uses child themes, making it even easier to develop with. Unfortunately, child themes for Ashford are as yet limited.

## Sandbox

<a href="https://www.plaintxt.org/themes/sandbox/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/05f2c7b0-6672-45f7-bd08-d0759c7f918d/wpframework16.jpg" alt="Wordpress Framework" width="480" height="250" /></a>

The seemigly ageless <a href="https://www.plaintxt.org/themes/sandbox/">Sandbox</a>, is a useful tool for WordPress theme designers and developers, it can be easily developed solely with CSS, so beginners will feel comfortable not having to worry about PHP. Experienced developers and designers can accomplish almost anything with minimal work, thanks to the rich, semantic markup and profusion of classes dynamically generated by the Sandbox.

The main feature of the Sandbox, and the feature that has made it very popular, is its markup. The class-generating functions included with the Sandbox create an extensible and semantic XHTML structure. Please note, the Sandbox has only been tested up to WP 2.6.
