New Years' Eve is not far past, and yet one twelfth of the new year is already behind us. We think this is a great time to release the first new free icon set of the year. So without further ado, today we’re pleased to release the _Months Of The Year_ icons: a set of 12 images that are all available in EPS, PDF, SVG and PNG formats. This icon set was designed by [Manuela Langella](https://manuelalangella.com/) and is free to be used in personal as well as commercial projects.

### Insights From The Designer

<blockquote>
<p>“This time I created a fun set of icons representing the months of the year. Every icon has a descriptive text, but you are free to reinterpret it as the place you live requires &mdash; January, for instance, is cold in Italy but warm in Australia :)

I drew them first, then created them digitally with Illustrator. I love cartoon style, and you can see it in this pack too.”<br /><br />&mdash; <a href="https://manuelalangella.com/">Manuela Langella</a>
</blockquote>

A big _thank you_ to [Manuela Langella](https://manuelalangella.com/) for designing this wonderful icon set &mdash; we sincerely appreciate your time and efforts!

BTW, Manuela is **available for hire and new projects** too. You should [contact her](https://www.manuelalangella.com/en/contacts/) today, she’s a really nice person to work with.

Keep up the great work!
