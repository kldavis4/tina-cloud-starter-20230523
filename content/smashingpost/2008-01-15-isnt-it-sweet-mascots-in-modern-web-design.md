The more <strong>emotional</strong> a site design is, the more likely it is to evoke positive feelings within its visitors. To achieve a lasting impression, designers tend to use visual cues and offer some eye candy for hurried and hectic users. E.g. vibrant color schemes, photos and illustrations can be used to draw user's attention to some specific site section. 

But are there any further options? Yes, there are. Actually, <em>mascots</em> are traditional for sports competitions such as Football World Championship or Olympic Games. <strong>Mascot</strong> is a more or less nicely designed creature which is symbolic for something and is supposed to evoke sympathy and strengthen the sense of belonging to one single team.

Today mascots are used almost <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mascots">everywhere</a> — e.g. by a number of software applications, groups and communties. It can also support the corporate identity for companies and services. Consequently, they are also becoming more and more popular in web designs.</p>

## What Do Mascots Look Like?

<strong>Animals and human-like creatures</strong> are used more frequently than some abstract creatures. The reason is quite trivial: users are more likely to associate their emotions with something they can easily recognize and find emotional binding to. Abstract creatures need to be studied and understood first. Most users don't have the time and patience to do that. And that's definitely not sometihng they are looking for in the first place. Still, abstract creatures are also possible.

As the carrier of positive feelings, mascots usually laugh and transport the feeling of joy, contentment and happiness. To leave a lasting impression, mascots have to look as <strong>cute</strong>, as <strong>sweet</strong>, as adorable, as pity and sometimes even as silly as possible. Unfortunately, most mascots have no names; however, having a name is rather usual for large communities as it can be easier referred to.

Some mascots are just hand-drawn illustrations, others are <strong>combined with a logo</strong>. They appear throughout the site and motivate users to some actions — e.g. to visit some site section or fill in the sign-up form.</p>

## Mascots in Web Design

A mascot can provide a site design with a <strong>fine and nice detail</strong> which the site would miss otherwise. This detail is used on private pages as often as in an online-shop or by a web-service. It's important that the final mascot design is clean and fits to the overall site design. For instance, a laughing beaver doesn't really help a site which tries to sell some underwater accessories.

We have collected a number of <strong>cute, well-designed and visually appealing mascots</strong>. The images are linked and lead to the pages from which they've been taken.
