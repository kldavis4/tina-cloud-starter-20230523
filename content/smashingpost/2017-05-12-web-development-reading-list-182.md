  When did you take your last **vacation**? For many of us, it was probably a
  long time ago. However, since quite a while, I stumble across more and more
  stories about companies that take unusual steps vacation-wise. Companies
  giving their employees a day off each week in summer or going on vacation
  together as a team building event instead of traveling somewhere just to work.

  But while there’s a **new generation building their dream work environments**,
  a lot of people still suffer from very bad working conditions. They work long
  hours and are discriminated or harassed by colleagues or their managers. And
  just this week, I heard that many company owners are desperate because
  “Generation Y” doesn’t want to work long hours anymore.

But while there’s a **new generation building their dream work environments**, a lot of people still suffer from very bad working conditions. They work long hours and are discriminated or harassed by colleagues or their managers. And just this week, I heard that many company owners are desperate because “Generation Y” doesn’t want to work long hours anymore.

As with every major break in generations, I think it’s good to have people standing up for their rights, enjoying their life and their work. But we also need to talk with executives who are under pressure to match deadlines. Because only if we show them evidence that working less can be beneficial for their employees’ health and productiveness, we can convince them to let us work more freely.</p>
