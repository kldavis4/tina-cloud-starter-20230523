### Insights From The Designers

<blockquote>"We were on the look out for a set of clothing icons for one of our projects; but we never really found the ones we liked. So we hit upon the idea of making a set of clothing icons, which would have every item of clothing we could think of. This set of icons consists of all the icons related to fashion and clothing; be it a shirt, a frock, even a hat and a scarf. We made sure each and every icon is pixel perfect and precise which will make it easier for everyone to use it to their preferences.

After making the whole set, we felt the need to share this pack with everyone out there searching for good looking clothing icons for their projects. We hope they find it useful in any of their projects and share the collection with others too. Cheers!"</blockquote>

A big thank you to <em>Creativebin</em> — we sincerely appreciate your time and efforts. Keep up the brilliant work!
