  We love exploring opportunities. While many of us are quite familiar with
  publications and events surrounding us, we often lack the global perspective
  on what's happening in the web industry across the world. For example, do you
  know what the state of web design in Singapore is? What about front-end
  events in Kuala Lumpur? What about the acceptance of UX-driven processes in
  Hong Kong? That's exactly what we want to find out!
categories:
  - Events
  - Web Design

For that reason, we're happy to have teamed up with our friends at Mozilla for the [Developer Roadshow Asia](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/02/devroadshow/), so we can connect and learn from designers and developers in southeastern Asia. Together, we're planning on organizing a series of informal, free **meetup-style events** for people who build for the web. On September 19th to 25th, folks from around the globe will be getting together in Singapore, Ho Chi Minh City, Kuala Lumpur, Penang and Hong Kong. Do join us, won't you?

## So, What’s The Roadshow About?

Five days, four countries, five cities: the Mozilla Developer Roadshow Asia aims to connect local communities and build lasting relationships. With our meet-ups, we'll explore how agencies and companies in Southeast Asia work, and what their processes are like: from graphic design tools to build tools, frameworks and libraries.

We'll also **dive deep into bleeding edge web technology**, such as VR, [CSS Grid](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/09/the-css-grid-challenge-join-in/), Web Assembly and Service Workers. These are only a few of the topics that will be tackled on this journey, and there’ll be plenty of room to address key items that affect the browsers we use every day, too, of course! After the trip, we'll sum up our findings in detailed articles right here, on yours truly Smashing Magazine.</p>
