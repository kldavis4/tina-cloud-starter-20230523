### Insights From The Designer:

<blockquote>"Do I like icons? No, I absolutely adore icons! I started creating them about 4 years ago, and now I just can't stop. I create them for work, for fun and for everyone. One of my favorite components of icon creation is that there's always a new shape, style or size to design for. Which constantly keeps things feeling fresh and exciting. This iconset was designed as a thank you letter to all the people that make the internet the awesome place that it is."</blockquote>
