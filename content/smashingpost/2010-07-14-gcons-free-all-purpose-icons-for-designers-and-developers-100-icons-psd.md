### Behind the design

As always, here are some insights from the designer:

"The open-source world is overwhelmed with design resources. For UI designers and website developers, there are a huge number of nice icon collections, but most of these collections are designed for a specific purpose, theme or industry. Most of the time, designers have to mix and match desired icons and customize them according to the requirements resulting in a lot of effort, un-balanced designs, and sometimes mere frustration. As a designer, I often feel the need of a set of generic icons that I can use easily in any design theme without having to customize their design, combination or color.

gcons is my contribution to the world of open source resources for designers and web developers. These icons are multi-purpose and can be a good fit in a number of scenarios like UI themes, technical diagrams, website design, prototype development etc.

Thank you very much, Sarfraz! We appreciate your efforts.</p>
