<p>Time flies! Did you know that it has been more than nine years already since we first embarked on our <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/category/wallpapers">wallpapers adventure</a>? Nine years is a long time, and sometimes we all should break out of our comfort zones and try something new, right?</p>

<p>We'd love to invite you to a little creativity challenge: Get out your pens, paint brushes, camera, or fire up your favorite illustration tool, and <strong>design a desktop wallpaper for March 2018</strong>. Now here comes the twist: Your wallpaper should fit the theme "<strong>Exploring New Worlds</strong>." </p>

<p>What you make out of it is entirely up to you. Maybe you want to design your own little sci-fi universe, or maybe you've explored the world in a campervan and discovered hidden places you fell in love with that you want to tell us about, or maybe&hellip; well, you decide what "Exploring New Worlds" means to you. At the end of the contest, we'll publish the best entries in an article. And, psst, there's a <strong>handsome prize waiting for one lucky winner</strong>, too. Join in!</p>

## The Challenge

<p>As mentioned above, all you need to do is design a desktop wallpaper around the theme "Exploring New Worlds" in two versions:</p>

<ul>
<li>One with a calendar for March 2018 and</li>
<li>One without a calendar for March 2018.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please make sure to <strong>read the following guidelines carefully</strong> before you get started (we've also collected them in a <a href="https://smashingconf.com/pdf/wallpaper-guidelines.pdf">PDF</a> for you).</p>

<p>The <strong>deadline is Sunday, February 25th, 2018</strong>.</p>

### Submission Guidelines

<ol>
<li>Please design <strong>two versions</strong> of your wallpaper. One with and one without a calendar for March 2018. This way, your wallpaper remains useful even after the month has ended. The calendar should be in English.</li>
<li>Make sure the wallpaper contains a <strong>Smashing Magazine logo</strong>. You can download different versions of the logo at <a href="https://smashed.by/logos">https://smashed.by/logos</a>. Oh, and please feel free to include your own logo in it, too, if you want.</li>
<li>Submit your design in as many <strong>different screen resolutions</strong> as you can, so that as many readers as possible can enjoy your artwork on their desktops.</li>
<li>Name your files according to their resolutions and their formats (e.g., 1280x720.jpg or 1280x720.png), and <strong>save them in two separate folders</strong> named "cal" and "nocal".</li>
<li><strong>Fill in</strong> <a href="https://tools.smashingmagazine.com/wallpaper-form-generator/">this form</a>. It will generate a file which you need to send us together with your artwork.</li>
<li>You're almost there: Pack your "cal" and "nocal" folders as well as the generated form file into an <strong>archive</strong> (preferably .zip).</li>
</ol>

<p>Once you've bundled everything up, <strong>send us your package to the following address</strong>: <em>wallpapers</em>@<em>smashingmagazine.com</em>. If your ZIP is too large to send via email, please don't hesitate to provide us with a Dropbox or Google Drive link instead.</p>

## So, What Can You Win?

<p>To give your design workflow a power boost, we'll be awarding a <a href="https://eu-store.wacom.com/Catalog/Pen-Tablets/wacom-intuos-pro">Wacom Intuos Pro</a> (medium size) tablet to <strong>one lucky winner</strong> after the deadline has ended.</p>
