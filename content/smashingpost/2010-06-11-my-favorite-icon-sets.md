  I've been receiving a few emails lately asking me for some of the web design
  resources that I personally use. Well, I'd like to start sharing my resources
  with our readers so today, I've gathered up a collection of the icon sets that
  I have personally downloaded and use on a daily basis.

  One thing that I've emphasized before is to have a [collection of
  resources](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/03/designer-do-right-now/ "What Every
  Designer Should Do Right Now") at your disposal. There are a lot of different
  icons out there and choosing which ones to download and save in your resources
  can be difficult. I used to just be download happy and download every icon set
  that I found and I found that to be very ineffective as I would still end up
  having to sort through hundreds of folders looking for the right icons.
