### Behind the design

As always, here are some insights from the designer himself:
<blockquote>Dear Smashing Magazine readers, Xmas is coming! And we're as excited about it as you're. However, our inspiration comes from the work that we're crafting everyday. And so, to double the joy, Smashing Magazine and IconEden happily announce the immediate availability of "Yummy", our new icon set which heavily focuses on, ahem, <strong>food</strong>!

And it's all yours. Bake it into your projects, use it in your Xmas greetings, or simply imagine yourself enjoying it! Similar to previous collections, Yummy comes in vector and pixel formats and can be immediately built into your projects at no cost. And of course, we'd love to hear from you. Do let us know what you think about Yummy by either leaving us a comment.
