### Behind the Design

As usual, a word from the designers themselves:
<blockquote>When you start to design in a flat style, it can be hard to stop — harder than you think! That is exactly what happened to us when we designed the icons for Smallicons. It turned into a big project, which we hope will help designers and other professionals whose work is based on graphics one way or another.</blockquote>

<strong>Thank you</strong>, dear Nick and Greg, for creating this beautiful set! We appreciate your work and efforts!
