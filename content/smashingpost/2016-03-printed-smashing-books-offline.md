### Smashing Book #5: Real-Life Responsive Web Design

Responsive design is a default these days, but we are all still figuring out just the right process and techniques to better craft responsive websites. That’s why we created a new book — to **gather practical techniques and strategies** from people who have learned how to get things done right, in actual projects with actual real-world challenges.

<figure id="your-smashing-book" class="fwi"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Smashing-Book-5-1200px1.jpg"><img alt="The Smashing Book 5: Real-life Responsive Web Design" property="image" class="radius" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ecc3d353-08da-4b9d-a314-b0256bb1b88f/smashing-book-5-5001.jpg" /></a></figure>

Neatly packaged in a gorgeous hardcover, the book features practical front-end techniques and patterns from well-respected designers and developers. The book **isn’t concerned with trends or short-lived workarounds** — it should stand the test of time and as such, it’s focused on actual techniques used today in real-life projects. The techniques that you could apply to your websites today, too.

#### About the book

As designers and developers, we solve problems for a living. Yet, these problems are often quite tricky and complex, and the context of these problems requires us to be creative and flexible in our workflows. With responsive design, we are prompted to create scalable design systems that work well in unpredictable environments. To do that, we need to be pragmatic and find solutions that work well within given constraints. That’s why we created this book: to find techniques that have actually worked in real-life projects with <strong>real-world challenges</strong>.</p>

In this chapter, Vitaly will provide an overview of clever practical techniques for improving UX of responsive sites, with innovative approaches to designing "responsive modules" such as mega-drop downs, tables, calendars, accordions, maps, sliders, responsive PDF and responsive iconography — and a dash of anti-patterns to avoid as well.</p>

Perhaps a Retina image (only) to Retina screens, or an art-directed image to small screens, or a portrait image for portrait orientation, or perhaps .webp to browsers supporting the format — without performance hits. Since images are the heaviest assets on the web, dealing with them intelligently is both our responsibility and opportunity for more dynamic layouts. That's what native responsive images are for.<br /><br />In this chapter, Yoav discusses the different responsive images use cases and how we can use the native solution today to create performant responsive websites.

### Mobile Web Handbook

We have all been there. With Responsive Web Design (RWD) becoming a convenient strategy for device-agnostic design, we keep running into annoying technical issues that all those quirky (and not so quirky) mobile browsers are raising so very often. However, fixing these issues can be quite easy — once you understand _exactly_ why they come up.

Weird browser bugs, inconsistent **CSS/JavaScript** support, performance issues, mobile fragmentation and complicated nuances such as device pixels, viewports, zooming, touch event cascade, pointer/click events and the 300ms delay. To make sense of it all, we created _Mobile Web Handbook_, a new practical book by Peter-Paul Koch to **help you understand technical issues on mobile** and deal with them effectively.

<figure id="your-mobile-web-handbook" class="fwi"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/mobile-web-handbook-opt.png"><img alt="Mobile Web Handbook, a new Smashing Book by Peter-Paul Koch" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/5c9e7afc-26f9-4876-a1b2-2fb06436f8aa/mobile-web-handbook-opt.png" /></a></figure>

The book is useful to **mobile strategists, developers, designers**, and everyone willing to better understand the intricacies of mobile — both technical and market-related. Whether you want to get a better picture or dive deep into common browser bugs on mobile, this is just the book you need.

#### Why This Book Is For You

Developing websites for mobile is pretty much the same as it has always been, but it _does_ require you to learn a few new things, and some of them are quite confusing. In _Mobile Web Handbook_, you'll learn to:

1.  Make sense of the **mobile value chain** of operators and device/OS vendors,
2.  Distinguish between different **mobile/proxy browsers** and ongoing browser developments,
3.  See through the complicated browser situation on Android devices,
4.  Understand **CSS pixels**, physical pixels, device pixels,
5.  Make sense of layout viewport, visual viewport and ideal viewport,
6.  How **zooming** works and why page zoom is different than pinch zoom,
7.  The intricacies of the **meta viewport** and related CSS/JS properties,
8.  How to deal with technical issues of touch events in JS,
9.  Understand the **touch event cascade** and its bugs,
10.  Handle **300ms delay**, pointer events and the click event,
11.  Fix common bugs caused by `position: fixed`, `overflow: auto` and `background-attachment`,
12.  Set up a device testing lab and test on mobile,
13.  Reconsider outdated development practices,
14.  Adjust expectations for **mobile networks** and latency.

### Digital Adaptation

Nothing is more frustrating than **stubborn management** entangled in dated workflows and inefficient processes. That's why we created _Digital Adaptation_, a new practical book on how to help senior management understand the Web and adapt the business, culture, team structure and workflows accordingly. No fluff, no theory — just techniques and strategies that worked in practice, and showed results.

<td colspan="3"><p class="desc"><span class="lead">Summary</span> <span>&bull;</span> The core problem with digital, faced by many large organizations, is that they were formed before the web as we know it today existed. Their systems, processes, and (in many cases) people are not configured to support it. In this chapter, Paul discusses warning signs of digital incompatibility in your company, organizational and cultural barriers and changes that the new digital landscape has brought. This is a chapter of how most organizations struggle with their digital strategy and what you have to know to avoid the problems in a long run.</p>

Backed up by case studies and real-world examples, you'll also learn how to form a digital strategy and how to use guiding principles, digital policies, and a responsibility matrix to complement the strategy. The chapter also explains how reorganizing teams and processes will help tackle dated, inefficient departmental structures.</p>

The web can't be neatly separated from the rest of organization; what's necessary is a single organizational strategy that is heavily influenced by online.

If you don’t take action to change it, nobody else will. But if you do take action, there is a real opportunity to make your work more enjoyable and to have a real impact on your company.
