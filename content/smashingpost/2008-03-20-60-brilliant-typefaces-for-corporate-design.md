<strong>Typography</strong> is more than being legible and looking good. Among other things, effective typography manages to achieve two important objectives: a) to create an appropriate atmosphere and enable users to develop trust toward the site and b) to make sure visitors get the main message of the site and (if possible) become interested in the services offered on the site. Since written text is the most efficient instrument to communicate with visitors precisely and directly, the power of typography shouldn't be underestimated. [Updated Nov/15/2016]

To communicate effectively, typography requires appropriate <strong>typefaces</strong>. Last year we've presented <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/08/08/80-beautiful-fonts-typefaces-for-professional-design/">80 Beautiful Professional Fonts</a>, a selection of excellent typefaces one should be aware of when developing web-sites. Now it's time to update our selection with typefaces we've missed then and new typefaces which have been developed over the last year.

Below you'll find <strong>over 60 first-class corporate fonts</strong>. Please notice that they are not free; however, we've focused on typefaces which are definitely worth spending money on. So which typefaces are “bulletproof”? What fonts can be used effectively in almost every Corporate Design? And what are the options for unique, but still incredibly beautiful typefaces? Let's find out.</p>

<a href="https://www.fontshop.com/families/ff-meta-serif">FF Meta Serif</a>
A collaborative work by Erik Spiekermann, Christian Schwarty and Kris Sowersby. The designers created a typeface with metrics that are not identical to FF Meta, but optically the same. Now what you see is what you get, a <strong>harmonious serif/sans type system</strong>. FF Meta Serif is available in four weights: Book, Medium, Bold, and Black, each with Italics. All styles include Small Caps, lining and oldstyle figures in proportional and tabular widths, and a range of arrows and other symbols.

<a href="https://typographica.org/001127.php">Beorcana</a>
Beorcana is a calligraphic sans, or serifless roman. Beorcana is unusual for a sans serif type; it is <strong>designed for extended reading</strong>.

Designed by Carl Crossgrove. "Beorcana has what it takes to become a classic."

<a href="https://www.ewalthert.com/#agile">Agile Typeface</a>
This typeface was born as Endexamen of the postgraduate study TypeMedia in The Hague. Not released yet, but worth to be kept in mind.

<a href="https://typographica.org/001138.php">Graphik</a>
"I ended up drawing inspiration from all parts of the 20th century. The heavy end of the family is based in part on Paul Renner's Plak, a relatively obscure display typeface cut only in large sizes of woodtype, that is related to his heavier weights of Futura but has <strong>rounder, friendlier, fatter proportions</strong>". By Christian Schwartz.

Rondana
Rondana is a tribute to the purity of line and <strong>futuristic aesthetics</strong> of the 60s and 70s. Geometry in service of Typography, rather than opposite.

<a href="https://www.christianschwartz.com/stagsans.shtml">Stag Sans</a>
"The normal/quirky balance is a bit different in the heavy weights, which are more likely to be used for enormous headlines. The final result is a perfect match for Stag, and also works as a muscular counterpoint to just about any <strong>elegant serif face</strong>."

Candy Script
Inspired by Argentina and its culture, Alejandro Paul’s Candy Script captures the country’s spirit. It comes from the tradition of window sign painting, but its <strong>thick hand-brushed characters</strong> — with alternates for almost every upper and lowercase letter - have a personality all their own. Tons of OpenType alternates included, over 600 characters in all.

<a href="https://www.christianschwartz.com/publico.shtml">Publico</a>
The openness of the headline face made designing a matching text face very straightforward. Elegance gives way to sturdiness in the serifs, and the ball terminals are less pronounced, resulting in an even texture. Like Guardian Egyptian, Publico Text is drawn to work under the specific layout and printing conditions of newspapers but doesn't take its design cues from traditional newspaper typefaces, resulting in a <strong>fresh and contemporary look</strong>.

Affair
Affair is an new <strong>calligraphic typeface</strong> by Alejandro Paul with a party full of swash characters, ligatures, and ornaments. By default, it’s simply an elegant yet readable display face. Dress it up with alternates, and it becomes irresistibly attractive, in styles from glamourous to over-the-top.

<a href="https://typographica.org/001144.php">Malaga</a>
"At first glance Malaga has all the earmarks of a sturdy old style serif that would hold up well to any amount of reading. Healthy spacing, large x-height, short ascenders and descenders. It is the second glance that has you realizing that it is <strong>perfect as well for larger headlines and bolder statements</strong>." A modern classic by Xavier Dupré.
