In a creative field like design, we face an undeniable truth: our wells of inspiration are bound to run dry from time to time. In those periods of imaginative downtime, we seek out sources that can help us return the creative flow to our working process, and get us "back in the game." But when we need a quick recharge, where do we turn? Many of us have our favorite "go-to" places when we are victim to creative drought, though perhaps with a little help, our routinely chosen paths could change. Art inspirations can help. 

Although they are so different in their purpose, art and design have such a close relationship; extensive discussions, over the years, have tried to figure out what separates these two imaginative fields.</p>

## Art Inspirations with Individual Artist Portfolios

A great tactic on the quest for art-based inspiration is to directly tap into the source. Individual artist portfolios seldom cease to amaze, and plunge you into a flood of new impressions if you're willing to invest a little time. By observing artworks of individual artists, you can learn new techniques, compare their work to your work and improve your designing skills.</p>

### [Françoise Nielly](https://www.francoise-nielly.com/)

Françoise Nielly's work is soulful. Her paintings reflect some of the other media that have helped shape her creative voice, and that have led her artistic work to the inspirational heights it has scaled. The vivid use of colors, contrasts and shape make faces look broken, yet perfectly put together, like a mosaic. The emotion carried and transferred by each piece is powerful, and easily conveyed to the viewer.

### [Natalie Shau](https://natalieshau.carbonmade.com/)

Natalie Shau's style is whimsically dark as she digitally takes her imagination and pulls many exciting pieces from it, transforming her vision into an eerie reality. Her work at times can leave you feeling a little uncomfortable, but you are almost guaranteed to develop a sense for her art.

### [Thomas Schostok](https://www.ths.nu/)

Thomas Schostok is an artist whose body of grungy, collage-style work has been an inspiration to many. His book, <em>Mr. Trash</em>, is a collection featuring his no-holds barred approach to artistic expression that captures his style wonderfully. He is definitely worth looking into, to get your creative flow in motion once again.

### [Øivind Hovland](https://www.oivindhovland.com)

Øivind Hovland's works of art have been published in renowned magazines and in a broad range of other media. His work concentrates on up-to-date topics, as he also illustrates for newspaper articles. If you allow his ironic designs to "get to you," you just might find the inspiration you were looking for. Øivind's style is very original: the artists avoid rectangual shapes, traditional shapes and common contrasts. A nice example of how breaking the rules can help artworks stand out.</p>

### [Lixiviandro Indra Harinanda](https://www.behance.net/encorethe4ngel)

This young Indonesian artist caught our attention with his complex, abstract compositions. Differing styles, and the varying, vibrant use of colors, make his artwork a refreshing stroll through inspiration. And it is proof, once again, that art does not always have to be viewed in 3D.

### [Evgeny Kiselev](https://www.ekiselev.com/)

Evgeny Kislelev dazzles with his collection of digital art and design. The depth and intricate, abstract nature of the work in his portfolio leaves a lasting impressions, with layer upon layer of colorful, boundless artistic expression partially reminiscent of Southeast Asian batik design, others wholly composed of symmetrical perfection.

### [Caroline Morin](https://carolinemorin.com/)

Caroline Morin is an illustrator with a knack for capturing the personality of her subjects. Not to mention the seeming ease with which she conveys this instilled quality, to the viewer. Her work is subtle, and the illustrator uses just a couple of colors, yet her portraits nicely depict human soul and mood.

### [Nata Metlukh](https://www.notofagus.com/)

Nata Metlukh's work spans genres and formats, pulling together some inspiring pieces of art that can offer the fans of dark, vibrant art among us, a healthy dose of inspirational refueling.

### [Robert Carter](https://www.crackedhat.com/)

Robert Carter's life-like renderings truly capture the attitude and emotion of the subject. The satirical connotations of his artwork strongly influence the subjective perception of each piece.

### [Liza Corbett](https://lizacorbett.com/)

Liza Corbett's sketchy, imaginative works evoke a child-like sense of innocence while carrying somewhat darker connotations for some, which makes for an immensely powerful body of work. Liza's art is often abstract and not easy to undestand, and the strong contrast between the theme of her artworks and their "light" drawing nature is remarkable.

### [Alex Andreyev](https://alexandreev.com/)

Alex Andreyev's portfolio weighs heavily on the darker side; his artworks are surreal, concise and thought-provoking. The artists reveals that "by using limited toolset, [he is] able to achieve stylistic consistensy throughout my artwork." In fact, most artworks focus only on few central elements, leaving the rest in the calm and subtle background tones.
