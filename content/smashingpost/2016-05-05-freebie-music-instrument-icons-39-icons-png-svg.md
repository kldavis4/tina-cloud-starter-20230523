### Insights From The Designer

<blockquote>“Playing an instrument, making music, or simply enjoying music is one of the most hedonistic rituals of people. Science claims that music has a number of positive physiological effects on us, like reducing stress, boosting our motivation, or providing dopamine to our brain’s pleasure centres.

In celebration of all the good music out there, we’ve created this icon set, called Musical Instruments. This set contains 39 icons depicting the most popular musical instruments and objects of our time.”</blockquote>

A big thank you to <a href="https://iconcrafts.com/">IconCrafts</a> for designing this wonderful icon set — we sincerely appreciate your time and efforts!

Keep up the great work!
