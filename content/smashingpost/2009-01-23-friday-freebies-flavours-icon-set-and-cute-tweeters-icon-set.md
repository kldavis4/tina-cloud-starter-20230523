These Twitter icons were designed by the talented <a href="https://www.mirkku.com">Mirjami Manninen</a>, an illustrator from Finland who released the beautiful RSS feed set <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/07/55-free-high-quality-icon-sets/">Feed Me Animals</a> on Smashing Magazine last year.

### Behind the scenes

As usual, here are some insights from the designer herself:
<blockquote>I am an illustrator from Finland. While drawing for one design competition that was about Twitter, I started to really like this little bird, and decided to create a whole set for Smashing Magazine's readers. I am very excited of the mesh tool in illustrator, andIi want to encourage all designers to try it. I have found it very helpful in my icon design. Greetings to all Smashing Magazine readers!
