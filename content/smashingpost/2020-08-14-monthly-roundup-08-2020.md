Improvement is a matter of steady, ongoing iteration. If you’ve been around for a good while, you’ll know that Smashing has been through a good number of changes in the past: a new design, a new layout, a new technical stack, and so much more. Still, it was always done with quality content in mind.

For example, we recently rearranged the navigation bar at the top of the page &mdash; have you noticed? Take a closer look, and you’ll find some neatly [curated guides](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/guides/) on major topics covered in the magazine, conference talks, and elsewhere. Each guide brings together the best we have on that subject, to help you explore and learn. And speaking of guides, we just published a comprehensive [SEO guide](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/smashing-guide-search-engine-optimization/) earlier today!

Alongside our guides, printed books, eBooks and printed magazine, we’re thrilled to have yet another addition to our smashingly cherished gems: meet our brand new *[Interface Design Patterns Checklists](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/08/checklist-cards-release/)*. Co-founder of Smashing Magazine, Vitaly Friedman, has been collecting, curating and refining each checklist for years &mdash; we’re convinced that this deck of cards will prove to always be useful when designing and building *any* interface component. Really.

If you’d like to (virtually) meet Vitaly himself and dive deeper into the bits and pieces of smart interface design patterns, you can attend his upcoming online workshop on [Smart Interface Design Patterns](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/08/checklist-cards-release/#online-workshop) (2020 Edition) where you’ll explore hundreds of practical examples over 5×2.5h live sessions.

<p><em>Please note that the cards are <strong>currently only available in PDF format</strong> &mdash; we’re doing our best to print them as soon as it’s possible to ship worldwide!</em></p>

## Upcoming Online Events: See You There?

With still so many COVID-coaster emotions, we’re very sad about the ongoing situation and not being able to meet you in person, so we have decided to [move all of our physical events for 2020 online](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/07/smashingconf-online-2020/) in order to stay connected with our dear and valued community.

Despite the circumstances, we’re proud to have so many brilliant speakers on board, and to make the best of it all, you don’t even need to travel to meet them. So, we promise to deliver the same community feeling as much as possible, but from your very own home (office).

- [SmashingConf Live](https://smashingconf.com/live/) (August 20–21)  
*An event full of interactive and live sessions by a line-up of inspiring and knowledgeable speakers.*
- [SmashingConf Freiburg Online](https://smashingconf.com/freiburg-2020/) (Sept. 7–8)  
*Our ‘hometown’ conference is now being moved online and open for everybody to join in!*
- [SmashingConf Austin Online](https://smashingconf.com/austin-2020/) (Oct. 13–14)  
*We’ve combined the initial Austin and New York events that will take place in a timezone suitable to everyone.*
- [SmashingConf San Francisco Online](https://smashingconf.com/sf-2020/) (Nov. 10–11)  
*Two full days of front-end, UX and everything else that connects us and helps us get better at what we do.*

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://smashingconf.com/" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/935244dd-cd15-4530-8f7c-f54d9311c5d6/2020-smashing-online-events-preview.png" sizes="100vw" caption="We always look forward to learning, sharing and connecting with each other. <a href='https://smashingconf.com/'>Join in the fun</a> &mdash; we provide live captioning in English too!" alt="" >}}

For the conference experience, we’re using [Hopin](https://hopin.to/). It turned out to be the best option in terms of quality, reliability and accessibility, with reception and networking area, sponsor booths and breakout sessions. To join in, no installation is needed! Before the event, we’ll send you a magic link, so you can jump right into the conference.

## Learning And Networking, The Smashing Way

We know everyone’s busy &mdash; and may even have homeschooling and other things to figure out on top of that &mdash; so we want to support you while not wasting any of your precious time. We’ve **broken down our workshops into 2.5h-segments across days and weeks**, so that you can learn at your own pace and in your own time (*workshop materials and recordings included!*).

Please do take a look at our [bundle discounts](https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/registration#bundles) if you want to attend more than one workshop &mdash; you can save up to US$100 and have a little more to spend on ice cream! 😉

### The State Of Things In 2020

<p>With so much happening on the web every day, it’s difficult to keep track, but it’s even more difficult to pause for a moment, and a take a detailed look at where we actually are at the moment. Luckily, there are plenty of surveys and reports gathering some specific developments in a single place. <a href="https://2019.stateofcss.com/">State of CSS</a> and <a href="https://2019.stateofjs.com/">State of JS</a> highlight common trends in CSS and JavaScript. There are also studies on <a href="https://medium.com/google-design/state-of-design-systems-2019-ff5f26ada71">Design Systems in 2019</a>, <a href="https://ashleynolan.co.uk/blog/frontend-tooling-survey-2019-results">Front-End Tooling</a> and <a href="https://snyk.io/open-source-security-report/">Open Source Security</a>.</p>

### Practical Tips For Rebranding A Product

<p>Do we rebrand? And when is the right time to do so? A lot of product people are asking themselves these questions as their product becomes more mature. The team at Overflow was in the same situation a while ago.</p>

<figure><a title="Evolving the Overflow Brand" href="https://blog.overflow.io/evolving-the-overflow-brand-780a791a77ec"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://mcusercontent.com/16b832d9ad4b28edf261f34df/images/9bc037a8-698f-47f7-a7c8-020242726535.png" alt="Evolving the Overflow Brand" border="0"></a></figure>

<p>To reflect the evolution of their product from an easy-to-use, practical flow diagramming tool into a tool that is used for design communication and presentation workflows, they decided that it was time for a rebranding. In the article “<a href="https://blog.overflow.io/evolving-the-overflow-brand-780a791a77ec">Evolving the Overflow Brand</a>”, they share their approach and what they learned along the way. Interesting ideas and takeaways that you can incorporate into your own redesign process. One that particularly helps make the challenge more approachable: Think of your product as a human being and imagine what they are like and how they feel to visualize your brand’s new identity.</p>

### Disabled Buttons And How To Do Better

<p>“<a href="https://axesslab.com/disabled-buttons-suck/">Disabled buttons suck.</a>” It’s a strong statement that Hampus Sethfors makes against this widespread UI pattern. As Hampus argues, disabled buttons usually harm the user experience, causing irritation and confusion when nothing happens when a button that carries an action word like “Send” is clicked. But they do not only prevent people from completing tasks with as little effort as possible, disabled buttons also create barriers for people with disabilities &mdash; due to issues with low contrast and assistive technologies not being able to navigate to disabled buttons. Now, how can we do better?</p>

<figure><a title="Disabled buttons suck" href="https://axesslab.com/disabled-buttons-suck/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://mcusercontent.com/16b832d9ad4b28edf261f34df/images/fc799218-49c0-4835-a6cc-1b6f44f4620f.png" alt="Disabled buttons suck" border="0"></a></figure>

<p>Hampus suggests to keep buttons enabled by default and show an error message when a user clicks it. If you want to indicate that a button is disabled, you could use CSS to make it look a bit grayed out (considering contrast, of course) but keep it enabled and put focus on a meaningful error message. A small detail that makes a difference.</p>

### The “Back” Button UX

<p>We often spend quite a bit of time to get a feature just right, or enhance the design with bold interactive features. We measure the impact of our decisions in A/B tests, study conversion and click-through-rates, analyze traffic and search for common funnel issues. But the <strong>data conveys just a part of the story</strong>. More often than not, customers have very different issues, often unrelated with our features or design.</p>

<p>The quality of an experience shows in situations <strong>when something goes unexpectedly</strong>. What happens when the customer accidentally reloads the page in the middle of a checkout, e.g. when scrolling up and down on a mobile phone? Does the payment form get cleared out as a user notices a name’s typo on a review page? What happens when a customer hits the “Back” button in a multi-step-process within our single-page-application?</p>

<figure><a title="Design Patterns That Violate “Back” Button Expectations" href="https://baymard.com/blog/back-button-expectations"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://mcusercontent.com/16b832d9ad4b28edf261f34df/images/6e5520a3-8de2-430b-8d99-f69fc05d21b9.jpg" width="500" height="319" alt="Design Patterns That Violate “Back” Button Expectations" border="0"></a></figure>

<p>In fact, the unexpected “Back” button behavior often has severe usability issues, and some of them are highlighted in Baymard Institute’s article <a href="https://baymard.com/blog/back-button-expectations">Design Patterns That Violate “Back” Button Expectations</a>. It’s worth testing the “Back” button for overlays, lightboxes, anchor links and content jumps, infinite scroll and “load more” behavior, filtering and sorting, accordions, checkout and inline editing.</p>

<p>We can use the HTML5 History API, or specifically <code>history.pushState()</code> to invoke a URL change without a page reload. The article goes into detail highlighting common issues and solutions to get things just right. Worth reading and bookmarking, and coming back to every now and again.</p>

### A CSS-Only, Animated, Wrapping Underline

<p>Underlines are hard, especially if you want to do something that goes beyond the good ol’ <code>text-decoration: underline</code>. Inspired by a hover effect he saw in the link underline on Cassie Evans’ blog, Nicky Meulemann decided to create something similar: a <a href="https://nickymeuleman.netlify.app/blog/css-animated-wrapping-underline">colored underline with a hover effect</a> where the line retreats and is replaced by a differently colored line.</p>

<figure><a title="A CSS-only, animated, wrapping underline" href="https://nickymeuleman.netlify.app/blog/css-animated-wrapping-underline"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://mcusercontent.com/16b832d9ad4b28edf261f34df/images/429b9952-3488-4c33-a14f-4be85eef27ac.png" alt="A CSS-only, animated, wrapping underline" border="0"></a></figure>

<p>The twist: The lines should not touch during the animation and, most importantly, links that wrap onto new lines should have the underline beneath all lines. If you want to follow along step by step how it’s done, be sure to check out Nicky’s <a href="https://nickymeuleman.netlify.app/blog/css-animated-wrapping-underline">tutorial</a>.</p>
