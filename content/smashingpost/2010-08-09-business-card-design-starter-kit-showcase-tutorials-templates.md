## Showcase Of Original And Memorable Business Cards

### Letterpress Cards

Letterpress printing has actually been the only form of printing text and images since it was invented by Johannes Gutenberg in the 15th century. Because of its distinctive qualities, such as crisp and tangible impression onto paper, letterpress work is now widely used for branding and identity development. Letterpress gives stronger visual definition to type and artwork and has a special touch, which is why it’s a popular technique for business card printing. Below you can see some beautiful examples of letterpress business cards.

### Die-Cut Business Cards

Something else that determines a business card’s memorability and appeal is shape. Today many individuals, businesses and organizations die-cut their cards, going beyond traditional dimensions. Die-cutting is an effective way to make a business card eye-catching, unique and even interactive. But remember that a die-cut card should still be compact enough to fit in a standard wallet or card holder. Alternatively, you could suggest some other way to carry or hold your card. Some noteworthy die-cut business cards are showcased below.

Derrick Mitchell
Derrick Mitchell, a designer from Kalispell, Montana, creates his business cards by hand with chip board, screen printing, labels and stamps.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ideakitchn/4427453585/in/photostream/">Sean Gerety</a>

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ideakitchn/4427453585/in/photostream/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="228" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/541c8ef0-4cfc-4ab7-a554-5fac271bd55e/sean-gerety.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="500" height="375" /></a>

### Classic, With a Twist

Most of the business cards below have a classic rectangular shape and standard dimensions… but that is where their classic-ness ends. Creative ideas and skillful implementation make these cards look anything but ordinary.

<a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/coco/307178">Coco</a>
The amazing identity concept for COCO was created by Polish designer "Wallstreet Different Creature." This business card, as part of the overall branding, is pure style and beauty.

<a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/coco/307178"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="229" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/fdf674d4-c0c5-4e7d-86cb-61fbdfec6347/coco.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="500" height="353" /></a>

<a href="https://www.cardonizer.com/business_cards/erich_hartmann">Erich Hartmann</a><br>
<a href="https://erichhartmann.net">Erich Hartmann</a> designed his business card to spell out a bunch of his skills, along with his main occupation. This clever idea is nicely visualized by way of a two-sided card, with an offset logo on the front and letterpress on the back.

<a href="https://www.cardonizer.com/business_cards/erich_hartmann"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="230" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d39046e8-4873-45ea-944e-f51f30d3c826/erich-hartmann.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="500" height="311" /></a>

<a href="https://cardview.net/gallery/bkk-grill-business-card/437/">Grill Me </a>
To see the info on this business card, grill it against a fire, because the card is stamped with lemon juice for ink. Quite an original idea, but using this effect for non-essential information or for an image, rather than contact info, might be more reasonable.

<a href="https://cardview.net/gallery/bkk-grill-business-card/437/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="232" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0bef1d4e-77e5-407c-b45f-b1a6fe6508fe/grillme.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="500" height="583" /></a>

### Combining Techniques

When it comes to developing promotional material for a brand today, the variety of choice is impressive. With all the different printing techniques, the loads of diverse paper and material available and relatively cheap digital technology, the process of designing a business card is limited only by the designer’s imagination. The following business cards rely on both paper quality and printing methods to create a memorable experience.
