## Production & Process

<blockquote>"The purest and most thoughtful minds are those which love color the most."
-John Ruskin</blockquote>

I found this quote interesting so I decided that it would make for a good wallpaper. I quickly opened up Adobe Photoshop and got to work. I started with some <strong>wavy shapes</strong> that I colored purple. I decided to duplicate this shape into different layers and I painfully rotated them into place to fill the entire canvas. I also changed the colors on some of the layers. For the text, I decided to use Rockwell as the main font.

<strong>I really like the<a href="https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2009/07/18-creative-examples-of-typography-in-motion/"> kinetic typography</a> style</strong> so I decided to layout the text based on that style. I was pleased with the final result and this wallpaper actually stayed as my desktop wallpaper for over 3 weeks.
