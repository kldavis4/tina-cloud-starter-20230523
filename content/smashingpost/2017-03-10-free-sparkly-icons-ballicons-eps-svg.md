Or is it a secret treasure map and magic superpowers even? The icons offer a lot of room for interpretation which is what makes them so versatile.

Just look at the sparkle on the ruby, the illusion of motion the baseball icon creates, or the three-dimensional touch the keyboard icon gets with the power cord winding round its circle shape.

### Insights From The Designers

<blockquote>
<p>“Creation of icons is something special for our team, as it’s our first icon set which made us refuse from client work and concentrate on crafting content for other specialists. Ballicons and Ballicons 2 have become really popular, and today, after 2.5 years we’ve realized we’re willing to present another iteration of the icons from this series — even more striking and interesting.”</p>
