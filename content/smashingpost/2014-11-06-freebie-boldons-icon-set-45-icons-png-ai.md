### Insights From The Designers

<blockquote>"We're four designers who work alongside talented web designers, developers and more, and wanted to give something back to design community and to others who have helped us. This is why we have designed a set of 45 illustrated flat icons exclusively for Smashing Magazine. These icons were created to combine two of the most popular design trends, “flat” and “illustrated”. The colors used and shapes highlight the two trends successfully. The flat, illustrated icons are designed to work on a range of colored backgrounds and devices. It’s clear the flat design trend is here to stay; we hope this illustrated icon set adds diversity to your projects!"</blockquote>
