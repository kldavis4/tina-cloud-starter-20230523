Ah, these [mystery](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-smashing-book-mystery-is-resolved-gifs-crazy-people-all-that-malarkey/) [riddles](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-mystery-resolved-the-rain-that-never-stops-frightened-cats-cake-is-a-lie/) [never stop](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/03/31/the-mystery-is-resolved-a-story-of-invisible-letters-and-shady-characters/), do they? To celebrate the launch of the [SmashingConf Whistler](https://www.smashingconf.com/whistler-2014/), our very first conference in Canada, we’ve prepared a yet another riddle, and of course this time it's not going to be any easier!

So, how does it work this time? Well, below you'll find the first of a few **hidden animated GIFs that contain a secret Twitter hashtag**. Your job is to deconstruct that hashtag as fast as possible. To do that, you have to pay attention to the file name and **count objects** within the GIF (for example, "3 chairs") and search for them on Twitter (i.e. `#3chairs`).

If your guess is right, you'll find a tweet leading you to the next level. Once you've reached the last level (oh, you'll know when), just **tweet out all the hints in one single hashtag** to [@smashingmag](https://twitter.com/smashingmag) on Twitter! Not _that_ difficult, right?

 

Alright, let's get to business. Are you ready? Action! (And good luck!)

_Tip: Watch out for a hint in one of the frames in each of the GIFs. [Large view.](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/dedd89d5-359e-433e-8945-cd4cddff586c/it-might-get-windy-in-whistler.gif)_
