  Popular **JavaScript libraries** such as jQuery, MooTools, Prototype, Dojo and
  YUI can be great for accomplishing common JavaScript tasks. These libraries
  provide many functions, whether the matter is related to events or effects or
  AJAX. And if one of these libraries can’t do the job, a plug-in probably
  exists that can.

  Such flexibility is great but sometimes comes with a penalty (the size of
  JavaScript files being one of them). Although adopting a well-known JavaScript
  library is usually a wise decision, you may want to perform a task that can be
  accomplished by a more lightweight library dedicated exclusively to that task
  or that is not supported by the more popular JavaScript libraries.

  Below, we present **40 stand-alone JavaScript libraries that serve specific
  purposes**. These are not all the ones out there, but every Web designer or
  developer will find something helpful here.

<a href="https://stevenlevithan.com/regex/xregexp/">XRegExp</a>
Regular expressions can be already used in JavaScript with the RegExp object. <strong>XRegExp</strong> adds more power to RegExp with features that will be part of the browsers of tomorrow (according to proposals for ECMAScript 4 - ES4). Using the library, RegExp objects can be cached and reused, modifiers can be added to existing RegExp objects and more.

JavaScript URL Library
A library for handling and manipulating URLs more easily. It is possible to reach every part of a URL as a string and modify it when needed. This URL library is very new but already works as mentioned.</p>

## 6\. Fonts

typeface.js
An unobtrusive library for using any font on a website. Unlike popular solutions like <a href="https://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/sifr/">sIFR</a> or FLIR, <strong>typeface.js</strong> doesn’t require Flash and is 100% JavaScript. To use any font, upload the TrueType font file to a Web-based generator, and download the rendered JavaScript file and include it in your Web pages.

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/9b66ffcb-63f5-411b-8f0e-bbbd40395f32/typeface-js.gif" alt="Typeface.js" width="480" height="116" border="0" /></figure>

<figure><a href="https://getfirebug.com/lite.html"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/6fda2720-9e3b-41d6-8316-88267c3b5271/firebug-lite.jpg" alt="Firebug Lite" width="480" height="116" border="0" /></a></figure>

## 8\. Other

<a href="https://code.google.com/p/swfobject/">swfobject</a><br>
<strong>swfobject</strong> is the most popular and flexible method for embedding Flash movies. It is unobtrusive, generates valid markup and can detect the version of a user’s Flash Player, allowing you to display alternate content if the required Flash version is not loaded. A nice article on “why <strong>swfobject</strong> should be used” can be found <a href="https://www.alistapart.com/articles/flashembedcagematch/">here</a>.

<figure><a href="https://code.google.com/p/swfobject/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2db725b7-859c-4bbc-91e0-3516255a8221/swjobject.jpg" alt="swfobject" width="480" height="116" border="0" /></a></figure>

<a href="https://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/sorttable/">sorttable</a> and <a href="https://www.danvk.org/wp/dragtable/">dragtable</a>
Tables, like them or not, are still one of the best ways to present data. But they can be better: <strong>sorttable</strong> is a library that makes tabular data sortable, both ascending and descending. To do this, simply add class=”sortable” to the table. You can also exclude certain columns from being sorted and make either ascending or descending the default behavior. <strong>dragtable</strong> is another library that makes columns draggable. After inserting the library in the Web page, add class=”dragtable” to the table as above. Best of all, both libraries can be used together. Simply add class=”sortable dragtable” to the table after including both libraries in the Web page.

<a href="https://dillerdesign.com/experiment/DD_roundies/">DD_roundies</a> and <a href="https://www.dillerdesign.com/experiment/DD_belatedPNG/">DD_belatedPNG</a><br>

<strong>DD_belatedPNG</strong> is a library that provides a customizable fix for the notorious IE6 PNG problem. Whether the PNG is used as “src” or “background-image” <strong>DD_belatedPNG</strong> can fix it. Unlike other solutions, “background-position” and “background-repeat” properties work as expected too.

<a href="https://www.scriptiny.com/2008/04/custom-javascript-dialog-boxes/">Custom JavaScript Dialog Boxes</a>
A lightweight library (about 4.5 KB) for creating <strong>custom dialog boxes</strong>. Four boxes can be displayed: alerts, warnings, prompts, success. With a simple function, you can specify the title of the box, the content to be shown and how many seconds to show it for.

Starting with Google Reader and Gmail, keyboard shortcuts in Web applications have become popular because they improve usability so much. <strong>Shorcuts.js</strong> provides functions to handle keyboard shortcuts more easily. Using the library, it is possible to create hotkeys and run functions at the press of a button.

<a href="https://mapstraction.com/">Mapstraction</a>
There are several mapping providers that provide different APIs. If you need to switch providers (say from Google Maps to MapQuest), codes need to be updated. That’s where <strong>Mapstraction</strong> comes in. It provides a common API that covers most of the popular mapping providers. By simply updating a line of code, it is possible to switch between them.
