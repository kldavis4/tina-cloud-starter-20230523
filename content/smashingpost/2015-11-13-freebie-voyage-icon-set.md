### Insights From The Designer:

<blockquote>“Voyage was born out of the weeks I spent organizing a trip to Canada and the long 23 hour international flight to get there. The set covers everything from <strong>planning a trip and what you’ll need to take</strong>, to getting to and from the airport and finally arriving at your hotel. Voyage is <strong>great for travel blogs</strong> and all sorts of projects that require clean and sleek travel icons. Their simple and understated design makes them perfect for dropping into any design without any fuss.”</blockquote>

A big <em>thank you</em> to <a href="https://www.dvq.co.nz/">Matt @ DVQ</a> for designing this wonderful icon set — we sincerely appreciate your time and efforts! Keep up the brilliant work!
