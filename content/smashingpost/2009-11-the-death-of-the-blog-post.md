## Let's face it: the classic blog post is boring.Barring the text and images, each one generally has the <span class="highlight_light">exact same layout</span>. We see little originality from one post to the next. Of course, consistency and branding are extremely important to consider when designing a website or blog, but what about individuality? Does a blog post about <span class="highlight_light">kittens</span> deserve the same layout as one about <span class="highlight_light">CSS hacks?</span>![Standard Blogs in Death of the blog post](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/bf39ece1-a2a5-4366-8a67-0486484cc41f/standard-blogs.png)

While this is great, and we now have a wealth of blogs on countless topics, <span class="highlight_light">perhaps it's too easy?</span> Just thinking about the endless hours of effort that a print designer puts into creating the custom layout of a magazine article makes one respect the finished product so much more.A few individuals out there, though, are really breaking the mold of the blogosphere.[![Dustin1 in Death of the blog post](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0200791d-9361-4410-87d3-32d51667da19/dustin1.png)](https://dustincurtis.com)These guys aren't using standard WordPress themes or cutting corners to make their lives easier. Rather, they are challenging themselves and producing some fantastic content.Pushing yourself to create original layouts and designs customized to the content of each post is a fascinating and entertaining way to build a blog.[![Greg1 in Death of the blog post](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/59aabd58-d3db-427d-af2a-ca001717f9d0/greg1.png)](https://gregorywood.co.uk)

### But why has this trend of melding blog post and magazine article, the <span style="color: rgb(224, 128, 89);">"blogazine,"</span> not caught on with the masses?

Invariably, two weeks after finishing a design, I feel like I can do better. When I originally tried to design my blog, I kept finishing a design, hating it and starting over. This happened ten or twelve times until I finally gave up. Eventually, I realized that <span class="pi_highlight">each post could stand on its own</span> and be its own design that fit the content. Despite the holdbacks of HTML and CSS, it has worked much better than I had even anticipated.</p><h5>Does having a blogazine really boost your creativity when it comes to creating a post?</h5><p>The blogazine style does seem to boost creativity, and by a huge amount. I feel an intense amount of freedom when I'm not constrained by the box of a pre-formed design. I can open Photoshop and use it as a word processor with design functionality. The design really does complement <span class="pi_highlight">&mdash; and become &mdash;</span> the content, because they are built simultaneously, without regard for any of the other stuff on the website.</p><blockquote class="quote_dustin"><p>I feel an intense amount of freedom when I'm not constrained by the box of pre-formed design.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/018a173f-f9c0-4b4e-b1f1-d80e4f0e7d39/dustin-twitter.png" style="margin-bottom: 80px;" alt="Dustin Twitter in Death of the blog post"></p><h5>Where do you get your inspiration for your blog articles?</h5><p>I get inspiration from everywhere. I'm fascinated by medicine and the human brain. So many of my articles center on interesting things that I've learned while studying neuroscience. Sometimes I'll start with a single word, like "sleep," and develop it into a whole article as I research the fringes of the field. <span class="pi_highlight">There's really no set source of inspiration</span>.</p></div></div><div class="adv_dis"><h5 style="margin: 30px 0pt 0pt 40px; width: 400px; clear: left; float: left;"> Advantages?</h5><h5 style="margin: 30px 30px 0pt 0px; width: 400px; float: right;"> Disadvantages?</h5><p class="pi_half_left_450">The main advantage is one I didn't anticipate. Doing a blogazine article requires a lot more work than a traditional blog post, and <span class="pi_highlight">that has kept me on my toes</span>; because such a large investment is required, I publish only what I feel are my best articles.</p><p class="pi_half_right_450">The biggest disadvantage is that CSS and HTML are terrible technologies that weren't designed for page layout. They were designed for structured content presentation, like for a newspaper, where all the elements throughout the website are the same and are re-used. But I'm trying to make a magazine, where <span class="pi_highlight">the content and presentation are inextricably mixed and unique</span>. The way presentation CSS is supposed to be decoupled from the content HTML is totally counter to the mission I am trying to accomplish, and it makes coding the articles frustrating, messy and time-consuming.</p><p class="pi_half_left_450">This seems to keep the quality fairly high. I start four or five articles for every one I publish. If I had a normal blog, that wouldn't be the case &mdash; the other four articles would be published too, even though they wouldn't be as good as the ones I do end up publishing.</p><p class="pi_half_right_450">My solution to this problem has basically been to ignore convention and use inline styling for most of the presentation code and extract the website-wide presentation layer into a separate CSS document. This takes forever and is not ideal. To put it lightly, I've developed a love-hate relationship with CSS.</p></div></div><div class="divider"><p> What if a print magazine</p><h3> used the same template for every article?</h3><p style="margin: 0pt auto 20px; text-align: right;"> It would be pretty boring, no?</p></div><div class="bz_pioneers_content"><div style="margin: 0pt auto; background-image: url(/wp-content/uploads/page/blogazine/img/number3.png); background-repeat: no-repeat; background-position: right top; width: 840px; min-height: 200px;"><h2 class="pioneer_name"> <a href="https://gregorywood.co.uk">Gregory Wood</a></h2><p style="margin: 0pt; width: 580px;">is a website designer at <a href="https://erskinedesign.com/">Erskine Design</a> and has created his website as an experiment in art direction.

I generally hate writing about Web-related stuff (I find it all a little boring), and <span class="pi_highlight">I love designing, so I wrote about what I wanted</span> (music and zombies) and designed each post around the content, although still housed in my old blog layout. The reception to the posts was really nice, and I enjoyed creating them, so for my latest website I set out to cater to that same audience and keep myself happily occupied at the same time.</p><h5>Does having a blogazine really boost your creativity when it comes to creating a post?</h5><p>I wouldn't say it boosts my creativity; the website is more of an outlet for it. Despite spending all week being creative at <a href="https://erskinedesign.com">Erskine Design</a>, it's still quite liberating to design whatever you want, however you want, with no external influence.</p><blockquote class="quote_greg" style="color: #967558; margin-left: 2.6em;"><p>Because it's all nicely designed, readers are drawn in and end up reading more than one post.</p></blockquote><h5>Where do you get your inspiration for your blog articles?</h5><p>Usually I think of my best ideas when cycling or sitting on a tram or bus. It's been a big thing on the Web over the years, where you get your inspiration from, and I've never really understood it. I think that looking at other people's work all the time for inspiration is massively constricting. <span class="pi_highlight">I find staring out a window for a while usually helps</span>.</p></div></div><div class="adv_dis2"><h5 style="margin: 30px 0pt 0pt 40px; width: 400px; clear: left; float: left;"> Advantages?</h5><h5 style="margin: 30px 30px 0pt 0px; width: 400px; float: right;"> Disadvantages?</h5><p class="pi_half_left_450">The obvious advantage is that it looks better. But the content is infinitely more captivating as well. I'm not a great writer, and I probably write a lot of bullshit, but <span class="pi_highlight">because it's all nicely designed, readers are drawn in and end up reading more than one post</span>. It's also very fun to create and helps me grow as a designer.</p><p class="pi_half_right_450">I guess some would say the time factor is a disadvantage, but <span class="pi_highlight">if you love doing something, spending a lot of time doing it is justified</span>.</p><p class="pi_half_right_450">I can't think of any disadvantages.</p></div></div></div><div id="bz_microblogging"><h2> The Microblogging Revolution</h2><p style="margin: 0pt; width: 350px;"><a href="https://twitter.com">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://posterous.com">Posterous</a>, <a href="https://flickr.com">Flickr</a>, <a href="https://facebook.com">Facebook</a>, the <a href="https://apple.com/iphone">iPhone</a> and countless other services make it incredibly easy for us to instantly post short musings, photos, video, thoughts and creations, which in turn has created a big gap between the micro post and the macro post.</p><h2 style="margin: 300px 0pt 0pt;">Time for the macro post to shine</h2><p style="margin: 0pt; width: 500px;">Longer blog posts with valuable content might not get the recognition they deserve, because the <span class="micro_highlight">140-character mindset</span> turns people off of reading several pages of text. One way to combat this and make your content more appealing is by creatively altering the layout, using the blogazine technique.</p><h2 style="margin: 270px 0pt 0pt 270px;">Bridging the gap</h2><p style="margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 270px; width: 500px;">We don't know exactly where the world of blogging is headed in the next few years, but the increase in micro-blogging will definitely be a strong influence. Shorter attention spans call for drastic changes to the length of blog posts.  Blogazines could cater to a generation accustomed to the longer articles of newspapers and magazines, becoming a <span class="micro_highlight">bridge</span> between the traditional article and the TwitPic.</p><div id="end_adv_dis"><div class="end_adv"><h3>Forces you to think more creatively</h3><p>Slipping into the habit of typing up your thoughts and clicking "Post," without thinking about the layout of each article, is easy.  By taking a little extra time for the art of blogging, your creativity will increase with your efforts.</p><h3>Something different and exciting for your readers</h3><p>If <a href="https://www.netmag.co.uk/">.Net</a> or <a href="https://computerarts.co.uk">Computer Arts</a> printed every article with the same layout, every month, would you still subscribe? Your readers would more likely return for new articles if they anticipate something new and rewarding.</p><h3>Reduces the number of short simple posts</h3><p>Your blog posts will have much more weight if you take the time to create a full article, rather than knock of a rushed post.</p><h3>Makes wordy posts more readable</h3><p>If all you have is text, text, text, then people will be less likely to read it.  Put a little effort into styling the content, and your post will become much more readable.</p></div><div class="end_dis"><h3> It takes serious effort</h3><p>Hand-crafting each blog post won't be easy, but the rewards will be well worth it.</p><h3>You need CSS and HTML experience</h3><p>Anyone can download a WordPress theme and merrily post an article. But building a custom layout requires some experience with CSS and HTML.</p><h3> Inconsistency</h3><p>The layout of your blog will change dramatically from post to post and, if not done right, may strike your readers as being awkwardly inconsistent. Just look at Jason Santa Maria's work. Every post is radically different for a reason, but a consistent vein runs through the posts.</p><h3> No print layout experience</h3><p>Because this style borrows many elements from print design, anyone who has worked only in Web design may find it difficult to change their way of thinking.  Rules of typography and white space, for example, may throw you off. But practice makes perfect, and an endless supply of inspiration can be found in creative magazines.</p></div></div></div><div id="bz_foryou"><div class="bz_foryou_content"> <img src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/aa53c67f-cf46-4d76-8758-ee01b160c74e/foryou-question.png" style="margin: 0pt auto;" alt="Foryou Question in Death of the blog post"><br><h3>Obviously this style isn't suitable for every website.

Instead of following the tired old practice of positioning screenshots of your work in a nice grid one after the other, why not use the blogazine technique and design a fresh page for each project according to the <span class="foryou_highlight">subject, client and color scheme</span>?</p></div><h2 style="margin: 180px 0pt 30px 40px;"> Online Shops</h2><p class="shop_black">Many online shops suffer from a certain blandness, following the pattern of: <span class="foryou_highlight">thumbnail grid</span>, name, short description and then pagination.</p><p class="shop_black">This layout may be good for usability, but there is a middle ground between scannability and visual appeal.</p><p class="shop_black">The design changes do not have to be dramatic.

While some of the higher-profile examples like <a href="https://siteinspire.net">SiteInspire</a> are fantastic for gaining inspiration, the constant influx of CSS galleries makes the inclusion of your own design in one of them somewhat less of an achievement. </p><p>It would be interesting to see a really <span class="foryou_highlight">high-class CSS gallery</span> adopt the blogazine technique, with a custom page made for each worthy website, using large high-quality images instead of the typical screenshots. </p><p>The websites in a CSS gallery are not all about the same topic and do not have the same style or same content, so <span class="foryou_highlight">why should they receive the same treatment</span> and same type of screenshot?</p><p>Merely for consistency?</p><p>Think about <span class="foryou_highlight">a painting</span> that is worthy of being displayed in an art gallery.
