In 2015, Microsoft launched its first new browser in 20 years: _Microsoft Edge_. After eight months, it's on a [great trajectory](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/status/) for web standards support, but there are many exciting features to come. This article is part of the web development series from our tech evangelists and engineers on JavaScript skills, community projects and best practices including [Microsoft Edge](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2015/05/06/a-break-from-the-past-part-2-saying-goodbye-to-activex-vbscript-attachevent/?wt.mc_id=DX_839721) browser and the new [EdgeHTML rendering engine](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2015/02/26/a-break-from-the-past-the-birth-of-microsofts-new-web-rendering-engine/?wt.mc_id=DX_839721).

Microsoft Edge has evolved over the past year — from being announced as a brand new browser, with Microsoft moving away from Trident (or MSHTML) to EdgeHTML, to the browser usage share increase curve similar to the one Google experienced when Chrome was first introduced in 2008.

Below you'll find a talk from Microsoft Edge Web Summit, a free conference organized and staffed by the engineers building Microsoft Edge and Chakra. There, you can find a full day of technical talks covering the EdgeHTML rendering engine, the open-source Chakra JavaScript engine, and developer tools. You can hear what's next for the web platform that powers Windows 10, straight from the engineers who build it, and you can get an inside look at powerful techniques and [new F12 Edge Developer tools](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/WebPlatformSummit/edgesummit2016/ES1610) to make your life as a developer just a little bit easier — e.g. for profiling or accessibility testing.
