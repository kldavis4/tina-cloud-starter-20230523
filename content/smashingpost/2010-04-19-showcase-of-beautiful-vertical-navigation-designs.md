Go to any website and you're guaranteed to find one thing: a navigation menu. Navigation menus enable visitors to move from page to page; without them, we would have no way to conveniently explore websites. Perhaps this is why designers, information architects, usability researchers and user experience specialists invest so much time and resources into devising aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly navigation systems.

Website navigation menus generally come in one of two orientations: vertical and horizontal. Horizontal navigation menus display items side by side. Vertical navigation menus stack items on top of each other. In this post, we highlight some remarkable vertical navigation menus, for your inspiration.

The vertical navigation in this portfolio website is simple and clean in looks yet robust in functionality and interaction. Clicking on "Web," "Print," or "Identity" filters the thumbnails on the right, and clicking the "About" menu item shifts the navigation to the right, making way for content on the left.

Here, you can see one of the benefits of vertical navigation: it allows for highly compact and modular menus that appear distinct from the rest of the layout. Sitting in the top-left corner, just below the website's name, the menu is one of the first things visitors see (at least with left-to-right languages).

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/06c5af97-6fa5-4c53-8eb4-6bc7b8f3aaf8/village-version.jpg" alt="Village Version" width="190" height="180" />

This portfolio has a clean and simple navigation design that leaves the visitor to focus on the vibrant content to the right.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/79756b5b-ac73-4c65-8f8d-751d947502eb/brunosouza.jpg" alt="brunosouza_projects" width="350" height="226" />

A quite distinctive, original navigation menu with five different typefaces. A bit unusual navigation for a crowdsourcing community.

<span class="removed_link" title="https://www.cambrianhouse.com/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f14a4445-b620-4319-ac8f-96da130714cf/cet.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="213" height="392" /></span>

Navigation menu on the right side of the layout for a change: although the design is basic, almost rudimentary, it works well and is easy to navigate. Navigation menus do not have to look outstanding.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2376e9e9-0556-478b-b06b-78a15671e8cc/cook.jpg" alt="Screenshot" width="333" height="351" />

This vertical navigation design is elegant and functional. Hovering over a menu item triggers a horizontal animation.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/09325475-3cde-4c7a-a4de-b6d0bc52522f/auberge-de-lull.jpg" alt="Auberge de l'ιll" width="352" height="360" />

This website's vertical navigation sits right in the middle of where the visitor is focusing when the page first loads. Active menu items are denoted by a pointing hand.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/15e1f162-7425-4163-b499-e921690e33f3/the-hipstery.jpg" alt="The Hipstery!" width="480" height="156" />

The navigation design for the Maryland Institute College of Arts demonstrates another advantage of vertical navigation: it shows hierarchy and allows you to group menu items without resorting to drop-down menus, whose sub-menus are displayed only when the user mouses over an item.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/96790def-7ad4-40f2-ba6f-ec3bff93083a/research-mica.jpg" alt="Research at MICA" width="199" height="589" />

The vertical navigation design on this website is positioned right below the website's name, making it prominent without drawing attention from the large rotating banner in the top-right.

The portfolio of art director Nick Jones has vertical navigation towards the middle of the page. The menu summarizes his work and has an interactive component that scrolls the menu up and down based on the user's mouse movements. When an item is clicked, the menu shifts to the left, making room for the corresponding content.

This simple vertical navigation is presented right below the website's name, giving it a prominent position in the layout without taking away attention from the main content area. A dark gray background denotes active menu items, with an arrowhead pointing at the content, encouraging natural and effective eye flow.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/497de8df-4cff-488b-a09a-de5dfac41257/tailored-pixels.jpg" alt="Tailored pixels" width="275" height="238" />
