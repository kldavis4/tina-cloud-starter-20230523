We’re having a meetup! Join us for Smashing Meets &mdash; two free online meetups with speakers, activities, and plenty of chances to make new friends. Just like a real meetup, though you’ll need to bring your own pizza.

## What Will Happen At Smashing Meets?

- 3&times;30-mins interactive talks from experts, followed by a short Q&A.
- Interactive activities in breakout rooms, with friendly communities around the world and collaborative design and coding challenges.
