## 1\. aLunch

<a href="https://mactips-lib.net/m/software/alunch/en/main.html">aLunch</a> is a very lightweight but powerful application that does what it is supposed to do and nothing more: a handy launcher that runs from within the menu bar. The application was written back in 2007, and two years later it still proves to be a strong contender.

{{% feature-panel %}}

[![aLaunch](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/3492ee25-2e65-44c0-8742-da61e3471cf7/01alunch.png)](https://mactips-lib.net/m/software/alunch/en/main.html)

aLunch helps you <strong>get all your apps organized and get an uncluttered dock</strong>. You can customize a hot key combination so a launcher window shows and let’s you choose either a Launcher window or go to the Launcher Menu. You can use this application with a Mac running OSX 10.4 or higher. If you have an earlier OS X such as 10.3, you need to update to version 10.3.9 to use an earlier version of the application.</p>

## 2\. Adobe Kuler

Adobe's Creative Suite 4 applications – Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, Fireworks and Flash – have an Extension panel that connects directly to <a href="https://kuler.adobe.com">Kuler</a>, the web-hosted <strong>application for generating color themes</strong>. Not many designers take advantage of a powerful tool like this one. Logging into Kuler.com with your Adobe ID, you can create color swatches themes from a color, share, rate and search the community color schemes, and upload or use a Flickr image to extract color themes so you can download them as an Adobe Swatch Exchange file that's compatible with Adobe applications.

[![Kuler](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/b487fb97-e3eb-4c81-80c6-cb457fbc42a2/02kuler.png)](https://kuler.adobe.com)

But you can also access the Kuler site from its own standalone application to get more flexibility. Also there is a Dashboard widget to help you browse through your color schemes and the communities. To install Kuler Desktop you need to have Mac OS X 10.4.11 or Mac OS X 10.5.4 and up, with <a href="www.adobe.com/products/air">Adobe Air</a> and Flash Player installed.</p>

## 3\. Name Changer

<a href="https://www.mrrsoftware.com/MRRSoftware/NameChanger.html">Name Changer</a> is a very straightforward and simple tool that will help you rename batches of files without the hassle of Automator or Photoshop batch change – the latter can get a little too technical for some users.

[![Name Changer](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e3e029fd-107a-45dd-bfca-b6c4882196ff/03namechanger.png)](https://www.mrrsoftware.com/MRRSoftware/NameChanger.html)

This application saves you the time of naming each file manually. Name Changer gives you a wide variety of options that go from select text replacement to fully customizable text replacement. Designed for OSX 10.5, NameChanger is a Universal Binary, so it runs on both Intel and PowerPC macs. If you have a OSX 10.3 or 10.4 Mac, there's a version that you can use too, so those Macs with earlier OS can still use the application.</p>

## 4\. YemuZip

<a href="https://www.yellowmug.com/yemuzip/">YemuZip</a> is a more <strong>powerful Zip-archive application</strong> that with a simple drag and drop interface, makes creating zip files an easy task. YemuZip lets you choose between a PC-compatible format and a Mac format that preserve all the Mac-specific metadata.

[![Name Changer](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d3be839f-5b1e-4fc6-bfe1-830cc987e1cb/04yemuzip.png)](https://www.yellowmug.com/yemuzip/)

The tool lets you choose the destination of your zip file (same as source, Desktop or Documents) and can attach the file to an email message for easy sending. Runs on OS X 10.4 or later and it is an Universal Binary.

## 5\. Dateline

A subtle replacement for having the date shown on the Menu bar, <a href="https://www.machinecodex.com/dateline/index.php">Dateline</a> gives you a linear calendar on your desktop within a transparent window. One very useful feature is that it has direct access to iCal when double clicking on a day.

[![Dateline](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c89c3c19-b9bf-4d0d-a405-9de25ed5b3d6/05dateline.jpeg)](https://www.machinecodex.com/dateline/index.php)

The background and text colors are fully customizable along with transparency to make it blend seamlessly with your current desktop. This application requires Mac OS X 10.5 and higher.</p>

## 6\. DropBox

<a href="https://www.getdropbox.com/">DropBox</a> is by far <strong>the easiest way to share files</strong> if you are on a low budget and do not want to be bothered with server side issues when sharing files with clients. Since it’s an application that runs in the background, you can leave it running and it does the file updates on the machines seamlessly. You have a 2GB limit for the free accounts, 50GB for the Pro account at $99.00 per year or a 100GB for the Premium account at US$199 per year.

Another useful aspect of this app is that you can sign in and access your files from any browser, not necessarily from your Mac. The file sharing is done over SSL and encrypted with AES-256 before storage, so they are safe. From the visual side, a blue sync mark shows when the files are syncing and a green check mark appears when it’s done. What’s best, it’s that it’s not just for Mac, it’s compatible with Windows and Linux.

[![DropBox](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/be507df2-e3bd-4ab6-a539-d32041a5b258/06dropbox.png)](https://www.getdropbox.com)

Every time you update a file, Dropbox transfers what was updated from the original uploaded file, so working with large Photoshop, Illustrator or InDesign documents is a breeze. If you need to share files with users that don’t have Dropbox, you can use your Public folder and all the files in that folder will be given a unique link so you can send that for a direct download. And if you accidentally delete a file, you can “undelete it” from the web interface. Overall, it’s a time saving application when you want a fast way to share files with clients or co-workers.</p>

## 7\. Quicksilver

Quicksilver is a <strong>powerful application launcher</strong>, an application that will create catalogs of your frequently used apps, folders and documents. What’s interesting is that the search grows and adapts from what you do everyday. One very useful feature, If you have all your contacts in Address Book is that you can search within Quicksilver the contact name and when you hit enter on the telephone number, it shows on big type over the screen, so it’s a quick way of looking at a phone number without launching Address Book itself. An alternative: <a href="https://amarsagoo.info/namely/">Namely</a>.

![Quickilver](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/3ace4b51-25f0-479b-8894-7c3c5425dd78/07quicksilver.png)

You can enhance Quicksilver with plugins to do more powerful things, like uploading files using applications as <a href="https://www.panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a>, Queue albums on <a href="https://www.apple.com/iTunes">iTunes</a>, emailing files or even moving the file’s location without doing it from the Finder. To run Quicksilver, you need a Mac with OS X 10.4 or higher.

## 8\. iClockr

This is a small application that <strong>tracks your work time</strong>. You can set up different projects, and tasks for each project, and associate them to a client. The concept around <a href="https://www.kedisoft.com/iclockr/">iClockr</a> is to have actions timed, for that you create tasks to be timed and those tasks add up to create a project. Each task is timed with a stopwatch, even the application's dock icon changes to a stopwatch.

[![iClockr](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e581ce30-f3f3-49b3-ba22-8716aa07efc9/08iclockr.jpeg)](https://www.kedisoft.com/iclockr/)

You can edit the task durations for better and more exact timing. iClockr also offers two modes to manage your times: Flat Rate or Range based. You can match each project with customers (within the application's Preferences pane). iClockr is a Mac Universal application that runs on Leopard only.</p>

## 9\. Caffeine

When <strong>video chatting</strong> or having a voice-only-call with a client, <a href="https://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/">Caffeine</a> has proved its place on Macs. Caffeine prevents your mac of going to sleep, dimming the screen and avoids the screen savers to start.

[![Caffeine](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d955cc74-72cc-41e0-b131-f744d4534530/09caffeine.png)](https://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/)

To get to the application's preferences, hold down the Command key while clicking to show the menu. Lightheads' website doesn't specify if Caffeine works with other OS versions different than Leopard.</p>

## 10\. iTool

iTool is a free application that offers a <strong>complete system maintenance and cleaning</strong>. It has a friendly user interface that guides you to complete the needed maitenance task.

![iTool](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/9f973c12-1683-4c67-8ea4-2db0093a3754/10itool.png)

Also, hidden on the Application menu (not found on the application's main window), you can reach other options to tweak the look of the Dock (2D or 3D) or the Finder among others. This application is Leopard only.</p>

## 11\. The Unarchiver

For those short on budget, there's a very light and powerfull free app called <a href="https://wakaba.c3.cx/s/apps/unarchiver.html">The Unarchiver</a>. It allows you to extract many more file formats besides the .zip, such as .tar-gzip, .tar-bzip2, .rar, 7-zip, .lhA and stuffIt. Also it better handles filenames from foreign character sets, created with non-English versions of other operating systems.

[![The Unarchiver](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/395396d7-a996-4c16-b821-e4b1eeaed638/11theunarchiver.png)](https://wakaba.c3.cx/s/apps/unarchiver.html)

The installation is very simple: copy the applications into your Applications folder and start using the application. The Unarchiver requires Mac OS X 10.3.9.</p>

## 12\. Paparazzi!
