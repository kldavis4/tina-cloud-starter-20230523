Designing a beautiful, legible <strong>typeface</strong> is hard work and takes time and patience. The type family has to convey a message clearly and effectively, regardless of the setting in which it is used. Of course, thousands of freely available fonts are out there, and <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/11/08/40-excellent-freefonts-for-professional-design/" rel="nofollow">some free fonts are very impressive</a>. Yet only a few free fonts manage to beat the look and feel of a carefully designed professional typeface, one that has been painstakingly developed over years with a close attention to tiny details. 

We looked around and researched recently released corporate typefaces that have been frequently recommended, mentioned or discussed on popular typography-related blogs, forums and magazines. In the end, we came up with a list of the most promising corporate typefaces and collected information about each of them. The result is this comprehensive showcase of typefaces, together with links to specimens and pricing information.

Below, you'll find 35 brilliant <em>new</em> typefaces for corporate design. Please note that they are <strong>not free</strong>, but we've focused on typefaces that are definitely worth spending money on. This showcase should serve as a great <strong>reference for professional designers</strong> looking for some fresh, beautiful typefaces for their corporate projects.</p>

Geogrotesque is a semi-modular typeface with a subtle rounded finish. All the characters are based on the same formal principle, with corresponding optical adjustments to adapt the system to an alphabet for texts. ?Although the type family has a geometric or “technological” construction, the rounded finish lends a warm appearance, making the typefaces more accessible.

## 3\. Museo and Museo Sans

<a href="https://www.myfonts.com/search/Museo/fonts/" rel="nofollow">Museo</a> | <a href="https://new.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/museo/gallery.html" rel="nofollow">Gallery</a> | Price: $29.95 for all five fonts
Museo is a clean yet unconventional semi-serif, designed by <a href="https://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/" rel="nofollow">Jos Buivenga</a>. This OpenType font family comes in five weights, and each weight comes with support for CE languages, even Esperanto.

<a href="https://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/locator/info.html" rel="nofollow">Locator</a> | Price: $250 (complete family)

<figure><img title="Locator" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e678101f-daa6-478d-a00d-d5febc1a599c/locator.gif" alt="Locator" width="500" height="457" /></figure>

## 7\. Madawaska

<a href="https://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/madawaska/" rel="nofollow">Madawaska</a> | <a href="https://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/madawaska/gallery.html" rel="nofollow">Gallery</a> | Price: $29.95 for all 34 fonts
Madawaska, a slab-serif family, has a bit of both: some of the ruggedness of the creator's display work, and the extensive structure of a text family. With seven weights, including some very subtle hairline versions, it’s versatile and widely usable. Madawaska comes with fractions, old-style numerals and lining numerals. This typeface may not look as solid and professional as others, but it gives your copy a <strong>modern, strong and original appearance</strong>.

<figure><a href="https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/madawaska/" rel="nofollow"><img title="Screenshot" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/bc1bf92a-4947-4087-b1c9-0c124708b1ee/androids.gif" alt="Screenshot" width="595" height="191" /></a></figure>

## 8\. Olicana

<a href="https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/g-type/olicana/">Olicana</a> | <a href="https://typographica.org/001153.php" rel="nofollow">PDF specimen</a> | Price: €79,00 per family
A beautiful typeface script in action. There are over 100 ligatures, which, when activated in a layout program, introduce more inconsistencies, making for a more convincing handwritten appearance. The typeface also has a more ornate style (swash feature), so the user has a choice between "old" and "new" styles. There are also replacement ligatures for double swashes appearing together.

<figure><a href="https://typographica.org/001153.php" rel="nofollow"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/97f26266-7d68-43f2-8f96-e6a337d6b58d/olicana.gif" alt="Professional Typefaces - Olicana by Nick Cooke" width="515" height="514" /></a></figure>

As a final touch of authenticity, there are eight difference lengths of strike-throughs. When inserted after a word, these special characters cross out the "mistake." There are also eight "splats," including ink blobs and even partial fingerprints. The typeface comes in two weights, rough and smooth. Designed by Nick Cooke.

## 9\. Ronnia

<a href="https://www.type-together.com/Ronnia" rel="nofollow">Ronnia</a> | <a href="https://www.type-together.com/downloadFile.php?file=resources/_pdfs/Ronnia.pdf" rel="nofollow">PDF specimen</a> | Price: €29+
One of the most remarkable characteristics of this humanistic sans-serif is its versatility. Ronnia has been engineered mainly for newspaper and magazine applications, as evidenced by its properties: economical in use, highly legible and friendly and charming in character. Ronnia was part of the Tipos Latinos exhibition 2008 and the 23rd Biennale of Graphic Design 2008 in Brno.

## 10\. Skolar

<a href="https://www.type-together.com/Skolar" rel="nofollow">Skolar</a> | <a href="https://www.type-together.com/downloadFile.php?file=resources/_pdfs/Skolar.pdf" rel="nofollow">PDF specimen</a> | Price: €49+
Skolar is a serifed typeface that has been designed specifically for scholarly multilingual publications. The relatively large x-height puts the typeface's proportions somewhere between a book and newspaper's typeface. The capitals are rather low compared to the ascenders to give the typeface even more texture and space for capital diacritical marks. These characteristics were introduced to improve readability in smaller sizes. Skolar received international recognition at the Ed-Awards competition 2008.

## 11\. Capsa

<a href="https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/capsa/" rel="nofollow">Capsa</a> | Price: $130 for 6 weights
Capsa was inspired by the work of mid-18th-century Parisian printer Claude Lamesle. It is an original design with classical flair, expert typesetting features and full, contemporary character sets. The Capsa family is an <strong>ideal book type</strong>: highly legible with beautifully fluid swash and italic styles. The Patterns and Vignettes fonts comprise a useful collection of decorative borders and ornaments. OpenType features include small caps, ligatures, alternates, old-style figures, lining figures, tabular figures, fractions, scientific inferiors, superscript, swashes, numerators, denominators and ordinals.

## 12\. FF Meta Serif

<a href="https://metaserif.com/">FF Meta Serif</a> | <a href="https://metaserif.com/gallery/" rel="nofollow">Gallery</a>
The OpenType version of FF Meta Serif offers Book, Medium, Bold and Black, each including italics and, of course, small caps, OSF, LF, TF and a range of arrows and other symbols. While it stands on its own in a wide range of applications, the extra benefit is its close relationship to the original FF Meta, its sans serif sister.

## 13\. Buffet Script

<a href="https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/buffet-script/" rel="nofollow">Buffet Script</a>
Buffet Script is based on <strong>calligraphy</strong> by Alf Becker, arguably the greatest American sign-lettering artist of all time. Buffet Script’s OpenType programming contains discretionary ligatures and stylistic and contextual alternates, all interacting with each other to allow the composition of just the right typographic look and feel. This font is best used where <strong>lush elegance</strong> is a design requirement.

<figure><a href="https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/buffet-script/" rel="nofollow"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e6de81de-e8a6-4673-9ce5-bfb440af59ff/typeface-29.png" alt="Professional Typefaces - Buffet Script" width="450" height="269" /></a></figure>

## 14\. Opal

<a href="https://www.slanted.de/eintrag/opal" rel="nofollow">Opal</a> | <a href="https://www.linotype.com/de/516966/opal-schriftfamilie.html" rel="nofollow">Preview</a> | Price: €70,21+ per typeface
Opal is a text face with noble aspirations, yearning for luxury and still delivering. Because of the long ascenders that rise clearly above the capital letters, Opal should be set with generous line spacing. The typeface's design has the attributes of the old-style Renaissance serifs, yet Opal is not based on any specific predecessors.

<figure><a href="https://www.slanted.de/eintrag/opal" rel="nofollow"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e56d5f06-5166-45bb-9463-e1f66b5bdbb8/opal1.gif" alt="Professional Typefaces - Type &amp; Graphics by Henning Skibbe" width="500" height="341" /></a></figure>

## 17\. Stag

<a href="https://commercialtype.com/catalog/stag">Stag</a> | Price: $50+
A new slab-serif for bold, forceful headlines, with a very large x-height, extremely short ascenders and descenders, and tight spacing, for a compact, contemporary look. In 2008, three new weights were added in order to match the full range of weights offered in Stag's sans-serif companion, Stag Sans, in the hope of adding more flexibility to this eccentric family. Designed by Christan Schwartz.

<figure><a href="https://commercialtype.com/catalog/stag"><img title="Screenshot" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2388a7ef-e30b-48b1-b86b-02389ffe54cf/stag.gif" alt="Screenshot" width="500" height="523" /></a></figure>

It introduces new aesthetic standards aimed to improve reading and writing skills and enhance the appeal of texts for pupils, students, teachers and office and IT staff at schools. It offers a clear, understandable and universal graphic tool for electronic typography, information systems and laying out primers, textbooks and educational texts and materials. The family consists of 19 fonts.

## 19\. Router

Router | PDF specimen| Price: $49+
Router is located at the intersection of mechanical and organic. Unlike other rounded sans-serifs with simple rounded terminals, Router flexes outward, mimicking the physical process of carving letters into plastic or metal. These details function exceptionally at display size, and disappear to satisfying effect in text, creating a legible, organic and evenly colored body copy.

## 21\. Kewl Script

<a href="https://sudtipos.com/fonts/112" rel="nofollow">Kewl Script</a> | Price: €59,00
Kewl Script is ideal for food packaging, book and music covers, magazines and window splashes. "The idea was to go on the heavier and more playful side, but with a South American sign-letterer's twist, rather than just good handwriting. I did some sketching, took some notes, then got busy with other projects. Some of that stuff eventually seeped into Candy Script and, to a lesser extent, the Whomp font. But it was only a matter of time before I got back to the original concept and finished it."

Designed by Mitja Miklavcic and initially created in 2006 to fulfill the requirements of an MA in Typeface Design, Tisa was primarily created for use in various magazines that are printed by either web-fed offset or gravure printing techniques.

Karmina Sans follows in the footsteps of its successful <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/type-together/karmina/" rel="nofollow">cousin</a>. While they share stylistic features, Karmina Sans was specifically designed to be a versatile tool for editorial designers. It comes in six weights with matching italics. Each of the OpenType fonts includes nearly 900 characters per weight, with small caps, multiple numeral styles, scientific superior and inferior figures and a set of symbols and arrows. Karmina Sans’ heavy variant delivers one of the darkest and most powerful text styles available, while the text weights are a perfect companion to Karmina Serif.

This is a revised design of the classic Mrs. Eaves, a transitional serif typeface designed by Zuzana Licko in 1996. The main distinguishing features of Mrs Eaves XL are its larger x-height, shorter ascenders and descenders and overall tighter spacing. These additional fonts expand the Mrs. Eaves family to a larger variety of uses, specifically those requiring economy of space. The larger x-height also allows a smaller point size to be used while maintaining readability. Mrs Eaves XL also has a narrow counterpart to the regular, with a set width of about 92%, which allows for even more compact uses.
