  Over the last year, Smashing Magazine has evolved. We've been publishing fewer lists and more in-depth articles about design and Web development. We have invited professionals and high-profile developers to write for us. We've been investing more resources in the quality and relevance of our articles. We've also explored new formats; and on weekends we've been publishing more inspirational pieces, leaving the in-depth articles to weekdays.
categories:
  - Coding
  - jQuery
  - Plugins
  - Resources
---
We've tried our best to fuel the growing appetite of our readers for more advanced articles, but recently we've been receiving more requests for carefully selected, useful round-ups. We are not big fans of lists either, but the format is useful and — if the resources are relevant — can be extremely helpful. Therefore, we've decided to add a couple of round-ups per month as a bonus to our regular articles. Instead of replacing the main articles, we will add round-ups on top of our regular schedule. If you don't like round-ups or find them inappropriate, please feel free to skip them. How does this work for you?

## Tips, Hints, Navigation

<a href="https://drew.tenderapp.com/kb/tiptip-jquery-plugin/how-to-use-it">TipTip jQuery Plugin</a>
TipTip detects the edges of the browser window and will make sure the tooltip stays within the current window size. As a result the tooltip will adjust itself to be displayed above, below, to the left or to the right of the element with TipTip applied to it, depending on what is necessary to stay within the browser window. TipTip is a very lightweight and intelligent custom tooltip jQuery plugin. It uses ZERO images and is completely customizable via CSS.

jSquares
jSquares is a jQuery plugin that pops up an image and a description in an overlay on hover. It is basically identical to the image grid found on <a href="https://www.ted.com">www.ted.com</a>. Works like a charm in IE6+, FF 3+, Safari 3+ and Opera 10.

<a href="https://labs.engageinteractive.co.uk/nav-o-matic/"> Nav-o-Matic</a>
Single sprite navigation is great, but we all know it can get a little bit tedious. All that measuring of pixel perfect photoshop slices, careful coding of your CSS and subsequent calculator bashing is enough to drive anyone to start microwaving fluffy kittens. Wouldn't it be great to have a fancy online tool to take care of all the boring stuff for you in a few simple clicks? Well wish no more...

Jquery Two Sided Multi Selector

It is visually customizable and exposes hooks for user-triggered events (like clicking or dragging an event).

Our latest contribution to labs is the selectmenu plugin, which is designed to duplicate and extend the functionality of a native HTML select element, and lets you customize the look and feel, add icons, and create hierarchy within the options. Best of all, it's built with progressive enhancement and accessibility in mind, has all the native mouse and keyboard controls, and is ThemeRoller-ready.

A Better jQuery In-Field Label Plugin
This is a pretty nice effect, and it can really help to save space on forms. There are a billion different ways to implement this, and I don't suggest you use the example from above because that was just a quick way to show the effect. So let's walk through a couple of different implementation approaches and figure out the best way to implement this feature.

![ A Better jQuery In-Field Label Plugin](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/cad6f7b9-35f6-47e3-9c4c-542467b68823/js-24.jpg)

<a href="https://www.csskarma.com/blog/sliding-labels-v2/">Sliding Labels</a>
Tim Wright came up with a jQuery technique that presents labels in input fields by default but then slides them to the left (or up) rather than removing them on click. If JavaScript is turned off, the labels are displayed above the input fields. The small jQuery snippet works in all major browsers and can be used for input and textarea elements.

[![Sliding Labels ](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2876ddd5-d888-49b4-b436-dc790509a781/js-59.jpg)](https://www.csskarma.com/blog/sliding-labels-v2/)

Some users doesn't like to filling the registration form. So that I had implemented login and singup fields in same block just controlling with jquery and PHP. It's is very simple javascript and basic PHP code.

Uniform - Sexy forms with jQuery
Have you ever wished you could style checkboxes, drop down menus, radio buttons, and file upload inputs? Ever wished you could control the look and feel of your form elements between all browsers? If so, Uniform is your new best friend. Uniform masks your standard form controls with custom themed controls. It works in sync with your real form elements to ensure accessibility and compatibility.

<a href="https://nivo.dev7studios.com/">Nivo Slider: Slideshow jQuery Script</a>
Nivo Slider is a simple and powerful jQuery image slider plug-in that fits the bill.

<a href="https://hashgrid.com/">#grid</a>
#grid is a little tool that inserts a grid onto the Web page. You can hold the grid in place and toggle it between the foreground and background. To display the grid, just press a hot key on your keyboard, and you can set your own short keys to switch views. #grid comes set up with a 980 pixel-wide container, with 20-pixel gutters, and assumes one lead of 20 pixels. You can download the source code (JavaScript and CSS) and use classes for multiple grids.

## Improving The Content

<a href="https://ignorethecode.net/blog/2010/04/20/footnotes/">Dynamic Footnotes With CSS and jQuery</a>
Lukas Mathis has come up with an elegant solution to improve user experience with footnotes: his jQuery script shows the content of footnotes as soon as the user indicates that they are interested in it - i.e. when they move the cursor over the footnote symbol.

### jQuery Captify Plugin v1.1.3

Captify is a plugin for jQuery written by Brian Reavis to display simple, pretty image captions that appear on rollover. It has been tested on Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and the wretched Internet Explorer. Captify was inspired by ImageCaptions, another jQuery plugin for displaying captions like these. The goal of Captify is to be easy to use, small/simple, and completely ready for use in production environments (unlike ImageCaptions at the moment).

![jQuery Captify Demo (v1.1.3)](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0f66e106-1951-4adf-9d0d-fcda5e823a5d/js-88.jpg)

With today’s post I will show you a contrived example to get you started. I eventually hope to add this to the contextMenu.js jQuery plugin that I use, but for now this should be pretty straight forward. I do want to note that in the demo and download I am loading the latest version of the jQuery library (1.3.1) from Google’s CDN for the first time in any of my posts. For more information on how to do this see the instructions from Google.

## Images and Visual Effects

jQuery imageless buttons a la Google
This jQuery plugin is an attempt to recreate Google's imageless buttons and prove that it doesn't take a whole team of engineers and an endless cycle of code revision and quality control (their own words) to pull this off. I don't know how Google did it, but my buttons automatically adapt to paddings and other styling you wish to use. They allow for a lot of stylistic customisatoin via a few lines of css while keeping all the display critical css rules hidden deep inside the plugin.

jQuery pageSlide
This plugin allows any developer to recreate a similar interaction on their own website using a few simple lines of Javascript. By attaching the method to an anchor tag, pageSlide wraps the original body content into a wrapper and creates an additional block for the secondary content load. The slide is animated whenever the click event is invoked.

Designing and coding a sponsors page is part of the developer’s life (at least the lucky developer’s life, if it is about a personal site of theirs). It, however, follows different rules than those for the other pages of the site. You have to find a way to fit a lot of information and organize it clearly, so that the emphasis is put on your sponsors, and not on other elements of your design.

CofeeScript
CoffeeScript is a little programming language that compiles JavaScript while simplifying the code that developers actually have to deal with. It works with current JavaScript libraries and compiles clean code, leaving even comments intact. Once developers familiarize themselves with how CoffeeScript works, they could potentially save themselves a lot of time and headaches with the simplified code.

![CoffeeScript](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/07bab9f2-85ec-4fd6-a5e5-38d981b66e74/coffeescript.jpg)
