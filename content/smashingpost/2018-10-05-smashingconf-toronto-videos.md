This year, many of your favorite speakers were featured at our conference in Toronto, however, things were quite different this time. The speakers had been asked to present without slides. Yep, and it was brilliant!

In this pairing of videos from [SmashingConf Toronto](https://smashingconf.com/toronto-2018/), discover sketching with Eva-Lotta Lamm and SVG Animation with Sarah Drasner, but if you fancy watching all of them then head on over to our [SmashingConf Vimeo channel](https://vimeo.com/album/5451191) anytime.

## How I Think When I Think Visually: Eva-Lotta Lamm

Sketching is something which lends itself perfectly to the no-slides format. In this talk, Eva-Lotta demonstrates her process for visual thinking. A method which helps her order her thoughts, create sketchnotes, and visualize processes such as user journeys.

## SVG And Vue Together From Start To Finish: Sarah Drasner

In this talk, Sarah starts with only an Illustrator document and by the end, makes it move! In this talk, which has an included GitHub repository to help you follow along, Sarah uses animation and Vue.js to create the final piece.
