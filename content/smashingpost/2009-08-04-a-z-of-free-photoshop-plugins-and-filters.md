  The **Photoshop** community is choc-full of many free resources, tutorials,
  tips and techniques, .psd files and even Actions. There is one area that it
  sadly lacks in, and that is free plugins and filters. Of course, Photoshop has
  been the pioneer in graphic editor development for a long time now, and with
  each new version (its current version is CS4) has added an endless supply of
  features and addons, and as a result, perhaps the need for free plugins or
  filters is no longer required. Or has it been ignored?

The <strong>Photoshop</strong> community is chock-full of many free resources, tutorials, tips and techniques, .psd files and even Actions. There is one area that it sadly lacks in, and that is free plugins, filters and panels. Of course, Photoshop has been the pioneer in graphic editor development for a long time now, and with each new version has added an endless supply of features and addons, and as a result, perhaps the need for free plugins or filters is no longer required. Or has it been ignored?

Traditionally plugins are an amateur photographer's best friend, take your shots, fire up Photoshop, apply some well preset filters, and hey presto you have a reasonably professional image. Professional photographers have been known to use plugins as a base and then tweak and add effects to achieve a personal professional touch. Plugins are basically an indispensable tool that do not receive the attention they deserve. And that brings us back to our original mystery, why are there so few free plugins and filters? Do you know the answer? I don't.

In this <strong>A-Z of free Photoshop plugins and filters</strong> you will find a few plugins that are (almost) as old as time itself, do not fear, they will work perfectly on all versions of Photoshop and the effect they produce are just as useful now as they were then. If you are looking for a simple and easy method to add effects to an image, this is the post for you.
