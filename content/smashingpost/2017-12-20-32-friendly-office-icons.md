<p>The web has changed the way we work. Startups rethought what offices look like, and with a laptop in your bag, you can get work done from anywhere anyways — no matter if it’s your desk at home or the cozy coffee shop around the corner. Over are the times of dark and stuffy cubicles — in many companies, at least.</p>

<p>To <strong>remove the dust from the term “office”</strong> and give the visuals revolving around it a fresh and friendly face, too, the creative minds at <a href="https://www.vexels.com/">Vexels</a> designed a set of 32 office-themed icons. And, well, it includes all the essentials that help us get work done: from the headphones you put on when you need to focus, to your favorite mug that gives you that extra caffeine shot on a long day, and the paper airplane you might fold in a lengthy meeting. The icons come in <strong>AI, EPS, SVG, and TIFF</strong> formats and can be downloaded for free.</p>
