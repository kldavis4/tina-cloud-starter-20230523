JavaScript is an amazing little language, but it’s got some quirks that turn a lot of people off. One of those quirks is <code>this</code>, and how it’s not necessarily what you expect it to be. <code>this</code> isn’t that complicated, but there are very few explanations of how it works on the internet. This article is an attempt to explain how <code>this</code> works and how to use it properly.

A compilation of best practices and good advice I’ve amassed over the years, much of it learnt the hard way (experimentation and suchlike). Take the advice below to heart and keep it in a part of your brain that has a quick access route so you can apply it without thinking about it. I am sure you will find things to disagree with, and that is a good thing - you should question what you read, and strive to find better solutions. However, I have found that following these principles has made me a more effective developer and allowed other developers to build upon my work more easily.
