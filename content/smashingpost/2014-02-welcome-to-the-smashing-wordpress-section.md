With WordPress' phenomenal growth, we've seen an explosion in the amount of WordPress-related content available on the web. There are plenty of beginner tutorials, round-up posts, and code snippets, but few good places to go for more advanced, in-depth content. With the [Smashing Magazine WordPress](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/category/wordpress/) section, we're aiming for quality articles on intermediate-level topics, with an emphasis on developing smarter, faster sites with the world's most popular publishing platform.

<p>Also, we'll be covering many aspects of WordPress, at a deeper level</strong>, and geared toward a more intermediate audience. If you're new to WordPress, that's fine too – we've got a series of tutorials lined up that will get you up to speed on techniques we'll be exploring in future articles.
