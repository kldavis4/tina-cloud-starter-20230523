CSS Trick for a Scrolling Transparent Background Effect  
Scroll the page to watch a battle between good and evil take shape. The effect requires two images: one transparent and one tiled gradient image. The gradient scrolls under the transparent PNG. Because it matches the colors in the PNG, each set of images disappears, depending on the part of the gradient they’re on top of.

[How To Create a Horizontally Scrolling Site](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-create-a-horizontally-scrolling-site/)  
If websites were made of wood, the grain would run up and down. Vertical is the natural flow of the Web. But browsers are equipped with vertical _and_ horizontal scroll bars, right? We have the choice to go against the grain and create web pages that scroll primarily horizontally and that even expand horizontally to accommodate more content. Perhaps a slight blow to usability, but a cool creative touch nonetheless!

Grayscale Hover Effect With CSS and jQuery  
A few months ago, James Padolsey introduced a cool grayscale technique for non-IE browsers. His technique inspired Soh Tanaka to come up with a workaround with a similar effect. His solution relies on CSS Sprites and a few lines of jQuery, but it requires a bit of preparation before implementation. It is not recommended for large-scale projects; it is probably best for portfolio pieces.

Codename Rainbows  
Some JavaScript and CSS magic is used here to apply a two-color gradient to text. Shadows and highlights can also be applied. This works especially well on big websites and for dynamic content where creating images for every instance would be impractical.

[3 Easy and Fast CSS Techniques for Faux Image Cropping](https://cssglobe.com/3-easy-and-fast-css-techniques-for-faux-image/)  
This article summarizes three fast and easy CSS techniques for displaying only a portion of an image. All of the techniques need only a couple of lines of CSS. You are not literally cropping, which is why it's called faux image cropping. These techniques can be helpful if you want to keep images to a certain size (for example, thumbnails in a news section). Being able to use CSS to control which portion of an image to display is great.

[Image Rollover Borders That Do Not Change Layout](https://css-tricks.com/image-rollover-borders-that-do-not-change-layout/)  
With CSS, the border of any block-level element is factored into the element's size in the layout. So, if you add a border to an element on hover, the layout will shift. In this post, you will find how to use the regular border property and create inner borders to get around that.

[Silhouette Fade-Ins](https://css-tricks.com/silhouette-fadeins/)  
To achieve the effect in the image above, first we need a DIV with the silhouettes as a background image. Then we put four images in that DIV, all the exact same size, with each band member highlighted. These images are hidden by default. Then you absolutely position four regions on top of the DIV; these are the roll-over link areas. With jQuery, we apply hover events to them, fading in the appropriate image.

Creating Triangles in CSS (the link was removed due to possible malware)  
Few people realize that a browser draws borders at angles. This technique takes advantage of that. One side of the border is given the color of the arrow, and the rest are transparent. Then you give the border a large width; the ones above are 20 pixels.

The idea here is not only to offer data visualization to people who aren't comfortable using scripting languages, but to demonstrate the power of CSS and offer a different way of using CSS.

[Tables: Not As Evil As You Think](https://www.zurb.com/article/206/tables-not-as-evil-as-you-think)  
Tables are evil, right? Yes and no. For tabular data, they're not, of course. That's what tables are for in the first place. CSS can do an excellent job of styling a properly formatted table, and the table structure provides good scaffolding for JavaScript calls. But what is addressed here is using tables for non-tabular data (i.e. for the layout). Yes, that's right: using tables for layout.

Perfect Drop-Down Log-In Box Like Twitter Using jQuery  
This shows you how to create a Twitter-style drop-down log-in form using jQuery. It’s really easy, it saves space on the page and visitors feel comfortable with the awesome toggle form.

[Make a Select's Options Printable](https://css-tricks.com/making-selects-printable/)  
When printing a Web page with `select` elements on it, the select drop-down prints just as it looks on the Web. This of course is practically useless on the printed page. One option for handling this is to follow every `select` HTML element with an unordered list that duplicates the content. Hide the unordered list in your main CSS file and reveal it with your print style sheet. This is a reasonable approach, except that it's a big ol’ pain in the butt to deal with all the time. Let’s rely on jQuery to do the heavy lifting instead.

Disabled labels and the Trilemma plug-in  
The form above on the left makes use of the `disabled` attribute, but the default browser settings for `disabled` inputs don't contrast as much as one would like. To better distinguish at a glance between which inputs are disabled and enabled, the labels of disabled inputs in the form on the right are styled with a faint gray color.

Cross-browser drop shadows using pure CSS  
Most methods of adding drop-shadows to content blocks require additional HTML mark-up and one or more PNG images. But by combining the Glow and Shadow filters, something that fairly closely resembles the rendered CSS3 shadow can be achieved.
