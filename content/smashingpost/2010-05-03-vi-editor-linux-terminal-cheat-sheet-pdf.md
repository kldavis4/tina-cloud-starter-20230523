### Behind the design

As always, here are some insights from the designers:
<blockquote>We created the VI Editor cheat sheet because of the amount of time members of our team spend working in the Linux Terminal. Working on our web app is a full time occupation and for the developers, using the command line 24/7 can be exhausting. Forgetting a command here or there can really break up their workflow. So we put together the VI cheat sheet that can be used for quick reference as and when you need!</blockquote>

Thank you, guys. We really appreciate your work and your good intentions.</p>
