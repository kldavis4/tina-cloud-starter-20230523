  A couple of weeks ago we celebrated [Cartoons and Comic Strip Art](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/12/28/the-celebration-of-cartoons-and-comic-strip-art/) and, to be honest, there was a good reason why we took some time to research on this topic. The truth is that we are pretty tired of the same kind of content appearing in the Web over and over and over again. During our winter break in December we came up with some new ideas, concepts, formats and projects that we will try to achieve with Smashing Magazine in 2009.

Discussing new formats for SM, we came up with the idea of creating **a weekly cartoon** that would cover recent developments in web design and in the Web in general. In December we stumbled across [Paddy Donnelly](https://iampaddy.com/)'s blog, the home of a talented web designer and illustrator in Belfast, Northern Ireland and we've seen that Paddy is actually creating a comic strip on his blog. After a couple of e-mails we were pretty sure: we are going to have a regular comic strip, exclusively on Smashing Magazine and exclusively for Smashing Magazine readers.

In this post we present the **first episodes of the new Smashing Magazine cartoon / comic strip**. We are very excited about this new section in our magazine and we would love to hear your opinion about it! Please feel free to post your ideas, suggestions, remarks and critique in the comments to this post. Please also suggest story lines - e.g. what are the things that frustrate you most about the Web or web design? And, most importantly, have fun!
