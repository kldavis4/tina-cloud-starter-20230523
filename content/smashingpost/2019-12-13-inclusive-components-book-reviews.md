Tuesday, December 3, was the official release date for *Inclusive Components*, and the reception has been overwhelmingly positive. The book is already an essential resource for accessibility experts and developers.

## You Had Me At ‚ÄúInclusive!‚Äù

As the book makes its way to offices, doorsteps, and accessibility meetups all over the world, here are just a few of the mentions we‚Äôve seen so far.

<blockquote>‚ÄúWhile awareness of web accessibility has continually been increasing, the volume and types of errors on home pages suggests that awareness alone is not sufficient to ensuring a highly accessible web experience for users with disabilities [...] <strong>Inclusive Components</strong> provides precisely the type of guidance, examples, and knowledge necessary to help web authors not only consider accessible interfaces, but actually implement them.‚Äù<br /><br />&mdash; <a href="https://twitter.com/jared_w_smith">Jared Smith</a>, Associate Director of WebAIM</blockquote>

<blockquote>‚Äú[...] a practical approach to explaining how to build fully accessible UI components with a lot of examples. Understanding and embracing how to build accessible interfaces will improve the quality of our work, but more importantly, it can‚Äîsometimes drastically‚Äîimprove the experience of our users in many ways.‚Äù<br /><br />&mdash; Holger Bartel (<a href="https://foobartel.com/notes/accessibility-inclusive-components">Source</a>)</blockquote>

So many of us want to build inclusive interfaces, but don‚Äôt know where to begin. Heydon‚Äôs book provides an entry point: he takes some of the most common interface patterns and shows the reader **how to build them inclusively from the start**.

Developers can benefit from this approach right away, but accessibility professionals and consultants also gain a valuable resource for working with clients and teams. 

<blockquote>‚ÄúI have found Heydon Pickering to me one of the very best communicators about the subject of digital accessibility. He brings clarity to complex issues and is compelling about how and why accessibility is critically important.‚Äù<br /><br />&mdash; Sharron Rush, Executive Director of <a href="https://knowbility.org/">Knowbility</a></blockquote>

{{< rimg href="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d8c70e5b-b951-439e-8a2b-a300c7e2eeab/sharron-rush.jpg" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d8c70e5b-b951-439e-8a2b-a300c7e2eeab/sharron-rush.jpg" sizes="100vw" caption="Sharron Rush, Knowbility" alt="A photo of Sharon Russ" >}}

Sharron‚Äôs team runs Accessibility audits for existing sites and apps, and they often have to help clients establish new development approaches.

<blockquote>‚ÄúThe Knowbility team loves ‚ÄòInclusive Components‚Äô and highly recommends it to anyone who builds with accessibility in mind.‚Äù</blockquote>

Through step-by-step instructions and coding examples, the reader quickly sees **how existing habits can change to become more inclusive**.

Heydon also guested on the [Smashing Podcast](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/12/smashing-podcast-episode-4/) last week and summarized the book‚Äôs central theme:

<blockquote>‚ÄúThe idea was to both bring accessibility to design systems, but by the same token, think systemically when it comes to trying to address accessibility.‚Äù</blockquote>

## A Growing Library To Meet A Growing Need

[WebAIM](https://webaim.org/) conducted an accessibility analysis of the top million websites at the beginning of 2019‚Äî[the WebAIM Million](https://webaim.org/projects/million/)‚Äîand the results made a lot of developers and teams rethink their workflow. Accessibility and inclusion have always been important, but [seeing all of the errors and bloat spelled out](https://webaim.org/projects/million/#errors) was enlightening.

{{< rimg breakout="true" href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/#wcag" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/538504a8-fdc3-4deb-96e7-e58bb3f81aec/most-common-wcag-failures-large-preview.png" sizes="100vw" caption="The overall results from the <a href='https://webaim.org/projects/million/#wcag'>WebAIM Million</a>. 97.8% of the sites tested had detectable WCAG2 errors. (<a href='https://webaim.org/projects/million/#wcag'>Source</a>)" alt="A bar graph showing the categories and numbers of errors found during the WebAIM Million survey. Of the million homepages tested, 85% had Low Contrast, 68% had Missing alternative text, 58% had empty links, 52% had missing form labels, 33% had missing document language, and 25% had empty buttons." >}}

The demand for accessibility resources continues to grow as more companies decide to build sites, apps, and platforms that work for everyone. [*Inclusive Components*](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/printed-books/inclusive-components/) is just one of many accessibility resources Heydon has created to help meet this demand:

- ‚Äú[Inclusive Design Patterns](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/printed-books/inclusive-front-end-design-patterns/)‚Äù (Smashing, 2016)
- [The original Inclusive Components website](https://inclusive-components.design/) (est. March 2017)
- [Articles for Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/heydon-pickering//) and for [A List Apart](https://alistapart.com/author/heydonworks/)

Heydon‚Äôs new project with [Andy Bell](https://twitter.com/hankchizljaw), [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/), takes the same modular approach to CSS as *Inclusive Components* does for interface patterns.

## Where Shall We Go Next?

<p>Smashing‚Äôs accessibility resource list continues to grow, too. In addition to the <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/category/accessibility">accessibility articles and videos</a> we publish, the community regularly cites Adam Silver‚Äôs <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/printed-books/form-design-patterns/">Form Design Patterns</a> book as a valuable reference for building inclusive forms.</p>

We‚Äôre sure you‚Äôll find them useful!</p>
