Rule number one for designers of all kinds: use a contract. Sometimes, this is easier said than done. Should I use a service agreement? A retainer? A licensing contract? With the help of <a href="https://www.docracy.com">Docracy</a>, we collected the experience of many designers to provide a wide range of starting points for less experienced creative professionals, and to start <strong>a permanent free legal resource</strong> for the community.

Below you'll find a collection of legal documents curated by our fantastic community. We are looking for your feedback and contribution to grow this collection. Suggest more items or add the contract you use for your own work. You might also want to have a look at our already published set of <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/08/15/free-download-useful-legal-documents-for-designers-pdf/">10 basic agreements</a> for designers.

<strong>Important notice</strong>: free sample documents and commentary are never a substitute to legal advice. Because every situation can be different, only a lawyer can answer your legal questions and assist you with a contract. The contracts below are useful examples, but they are sourced from a community of people and come without any guarantee, so treat them as general information. Smashing Magazine and the respective contributors of the documents disclaim all liability in connection to the use of these documents.</p>
