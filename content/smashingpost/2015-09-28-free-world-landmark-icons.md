### Insights from the Designer

<blockquote>“We were searching for landmark icons for reference and realized that there were either only very basic icons or too much detailed icons available. Basic icons lose architectural elegance and detailed ones add chaos. There, we sensed a need of balancing both with latest design directions. We purposefully designed to work them best on both digital and print media as they are crisp, clean and clear. It was such a great fun and day by day, as we are asked to create more, the list is growing very fast! :) You can <a href="https://pugmarker.com/products/">check more icons</a> as well.”</blockquote>
