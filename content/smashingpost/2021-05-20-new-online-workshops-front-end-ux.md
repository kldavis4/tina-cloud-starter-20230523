How do we build and establish a **successful design system**? What about modern **CSS and JavaScript**? What’s the state of HTML Email? And what are new, smart **design patterns** we could use? What will it take us to move to TypeScript or Vue.js? With our [online workshops](https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/), we try to answer these questions well. 

Our workshops bring in knowledgeable, kind folks from the community to explore **real-life solutions** to real-life problems, live, with you. All sessions are broken down into **2.5h-segments** across days, so you always have time to ask questions, share your screen and get immediate feedback.

In fact, **live discussions and interactive exercises** are at the [very heart](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/10/how-we-run-smashing-online-workshops/) of every workshop, with group work, homework, reviews and live interaction with people around the world. Plus, you get all **video recordings** of all sessions, so you can re-watch at any time, in your comfy chair in familiar comfort of your workspace.

## Upcoming Workshops (May-September 2021)

No pre-recorded sessions, no big picture talks. Our workshops take place **live and span multiple days**. They are split into **2.5h-sessions**, plus you’ll get all workshop video recordings, slides and a friendly Q&amp;A in every session.

## What Are Online Workshops Like?

Do you experience **Zoom fatigue** as well? After all, who really wants to spend more time in front of their screen? That’s exactly why we’ve [designed the online workshop experience from scratch](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/10/how-we-run-smashing-online-workshops/), accounting for the time needed to take in all the content, understand it and have enough time to ask *just* the right questions.

<figure>
<a href="https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/"><img style="border-radius: 11px;" loading="lazy" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/394a4d0e-4c57-4d55-a72a-87f244ab1320/kececypa-1.png" width="605" height="371" alt="A panel of friendly cats, discussing front-end and UX online, of course." /></a>
<figcaption>In <a href="https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/">our workshops</a>, everybody is just a slightly blurry rectangle on the screen; everybody is equal, and invited to participate.</figcaption>
</figure>

Our online workshops take place **live** and span **multiple days across weeks.** They are split into 2.5h-sessions, and in every session there is always enough time to bring up your questions or just get a cup of tea. We don’t rush through the content, but instead try to create a welcoming, friendly and inclusive environment for everyone to have time to think, discuss and get feedback.

There are plenty of [things to expect from a Smashing workshop](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/02/smashing-workshop-form-design-masterclass/), but the most important one is focus on **practical examples** and techniques. The workshops aren’t talks; they are **interactive**, with live conversations with attendees, sometimes with challenges, homework and team work.

Of course, you get all workshop materials and **video recordings** as well, so if you miss a session you can re-watch it the same day.

### TL;DR
