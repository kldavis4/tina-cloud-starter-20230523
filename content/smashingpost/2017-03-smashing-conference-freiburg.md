  We are all **craftsmen** in a way, no matter if you create delightful
  experiences, snappy performances, or innovative products. While our tools now
  fit into the thinnest laptops or even the cloud, we still have much in common
  with the stonemasons and the carpenters who lived centuries before us. We
  share our knowledge to _get better_ and _more efficient_ at what we do, like
  in a guild.


  And what place could be better for a guild of **web designers and developers**
  to get together for a friendly conversation, to learn from each other and to
  spark new ideas at a location that lives and breathes centuries of crafted
  skills? We are headed back to the _Historic Merchants' Hall_ in our lovely
  hometown Freiburg, and we'd love you to join us there for [SmashingConf
  Freiburg 2017](https://smashingconf.com/freiburg-2017/)!
