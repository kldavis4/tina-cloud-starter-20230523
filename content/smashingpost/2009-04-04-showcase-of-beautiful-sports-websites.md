## Trends In Sports Websites

As in any industry, sports websites have their own trends, as you will see below. However, because the websites showcased here fall into a number of different categories and serve different purposes, not all of the trends we discuss will be relevant or applicable to all types of sports websites.

{{% feature-panel %}}

<strong>1. Large Photos</strong>
Many of the best sports websites include a lot of images and photos, and many use large photos in the background or a featured area. News websites obviously include a lot of smaller photos to accompany current stories, but team websites and sports apparel websites in particular often rely on large photos as a prominent part of their design.

<strong>2. Colorful</strong>
Naturally, team and league websites are typically very colorful and highlight their official colors. Apparel and product websites are also frequently colorful.

<strong>3. News Area</strong>
Even websites that aren't news-focused, such as team and league websites and those of individual athletes, typically contain recent news items on the home page. As more sports fans turn to websites to get their news and stay up to date on their favorite players and teams, news and blog sections provide an opportunity for easy communication with few barriers.

<strong>4. Featured Content Area</strong>
News websites of course have certain sections in their layout for headline news, but even team and league websites now provide content in feature areas of the website. In many cases, this featured content area works in conjunction with the news headlines mentioned in the previous point. Most of the featured content sections have <strong>a slider</strong> or similar effect that moves readers from one featured item to the next. Most also allow the user to override the slideshow effect and control what content is shown in the featured area.

<strong>5. Network</strong>
Many of the leading sports news websites are part of larger networks. You will see many of them pointed out in the news section. Sometimes the sports section of the network is on its own domain, other times it is part of the main news website's domain.</p>

## Showcase

Let's look at a number of exemplary websites from the sports industry in several different categories.</p>

### News

<a href="https://espn.go.com/">ESPN</a>
The ESPN redesign a few months ago drew a lot of attention from sports fans. The front page features less content than some other major news websites and aims to improve the user experience with improved navigation to different sections of the website.

<a href="https://espn.go.com/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a8687b0a-f3d2-4457-81b4-365a294c1f02/espn.jpg" alt="ESPN" width="500" height="489" border="0" /></a>

<a href="https://nbcsports.msnbc.com/">NBC Sports</a>
The NBC Sports website is part of <a href="https://www.msnbc.msn.com/">MSNBC.com</a>, and it shares a similar look to the MSNBC front page in terms of layout and style. In this case, the familiar MSNBC header is replaced, but the side navigation and content area are much the same.

<a href="https://nbcsports.msnbc.com/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0ca857fd-d08a-40be-9211-b42948f14e35/nike.jpg" alt="NBC Sports" width="500" height="573" border="0" /></a>

<span class="removed_link" title="https://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/">Sports Illustrated </span>
Sports Illustrated's website is part of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/">CNN.com</a>. Like many sports news websites, Sports Illustrated has a scoreboard section at the very top of the page for games in progress or recently finished. SI uses a grid-based layout to present information from many different sports and leagues on its front page.

<span class="removed_link" title="https://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f8dc14d0-5808-48ba-8b4d-123ef2e82f43/si.jpg" alt="Sports Illustrated" width="500" height="555" border="0" /></span>

<a href="https://www.tsn.ca/">TSN</a>
TSN, Canada's sports network, has a typical news-style layout. Naturally, much of the content features ice hockey news and information. Content for various sports and leagues is available via the main navigation at the top of the page.

<a href="https://www.tsn.ca/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a45da169-c501-4044-b84f-a51fe57bed63/tsn.jpg" alt="TSN" width="500" height="557" border="0" /></a>

ESPN the Magazine
ESPN the Magazine has it's own website that is part of the larger ESPN website. The home page includes links to recent stories from the magazine, and the content area is a bit cleaner in design than many news websites.

<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/e1c0b7aa-0716-478e-af62-4c5f6e0b24d8/espnmag.jpg" alt="ESPN the Magazine" width="500" height="623" border="0" />

<a href="https://msn.foxsports.com/">Fox Sports</a>
The Fox Sports website is part of the <a href="https://msn.com/">MSN</a> network. The website includes a lot of content but does a pretty good job of keeping it organized. A drop-down navigation menu includes links to many specific pages for each sport or league.

<a href="https://msn.foxsports.com/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/81d5c636-357e-4d25-b683-f0987a74b47e/fox.jpg" alt="Fox Sports" width="500" height="488" border="0" /></a>

<a href="https://deadspin.com/">Deadspin</a>
Deadspin, the sports arm of the <a href="https://gawker.com/">Gawker Network</a>, has a design that will look familiar to visitors of the other Gawker websites, such as <a href="https://gizmodo.com/">Gizmodo</a> and <a href="https://lifehacker.com/">Lifehacker</a>. Featured items are shown at the very top of the page, and the main content area includes excerpts to additional items.

<a href="https://deadspin.com/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a47805d9-c1fb-4452-b559-33c795004b96/deadspin.jpg" alt="Deadspin" width="500" height="734" border="0" /></a>

<a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Sports</a>
Yahoo! Sports has a news-style layout, with navigation to sports and leagues at the top of the page. Unlike on some other sports news websites, the Yahoo! scoreboard is located in the sidebar rather than at the top of the page.

<a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0351e0e9-9749-4cf9-87d4-aa28ff1978a0/ysports.jpg" alt="Yahoo Sports" width="500" height="620" border="0" /></a>

<a href="https://www.theonion.com/content/sports">Onion Sports Network</a>
Satirical news website <a href="https://www.theonion.com/">The Onion</a> uses the Onion Sports Network for all of its sports stories. The Sports Network's front page has a grid-based layout, like The Onion's main front page, but with much less content. Navigation above the content leads to news on particular sports, as well as to other sections of The Onion.

<a href="https://www.theonion.com/content/sports"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4f19cb63-ecea-42ec-9f1c-3e72fe9a35e8/onion.jpg" alt="Onion Sports Network" width="500" height="535" border="0" /></a>
