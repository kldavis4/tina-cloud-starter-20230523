Argh! Weird browser bugs, inconsistent **CSS/JavaScript** support, performance issues, mobile fragmentation and complicated nuances such as device pixels, viewports, zooming, touch event cascade, pointer/click events and the 300ms delay. To make sense of it all, we created _The Mobile Web Handbook_, a new practical book by Peter-Paul Koch to **help you understand technical issues on mobile** and deal with them effectively.

We have all been there. With Responsive Web Design becoming a convenient strategy for device-agnostic design, we keep running into annoying technical issues that all those quirky (and not so quirky) mobile browsers are raising so very often. However, fixing these issues can be quite easy — once you understand exactly _why_ they come up.</p>

### Why This Book Is For You

Developing websites for mobile is pretty much the same as it has always been, but it _does_ require you to learn a few new things, and some of them are quite confusing. In _Mobile Web Handbook_, you'll learn to:

1.  Make sense of the **mobile value chain** of operators and device/OS vendors,
2.  Distinguish between different **mobile/proxy browsers** and ongoing browser developments,
3.  See through the complicated browser situation on Android devices,
4.  Understand **CSS pixels**, physical pixels, device pixels,
5.  Make sense of layout viewport, visual viewport and ideal viewport,
6.  How **zooming** works and why page zoom is different than pinch zoom,
7.  The intricacies of the **meta viewport** and related CSS/JS properties,
8.  How to deal with technical issues of touch events in JS,
9.  Understand the **touch event cascade** and its bugs,
10.  Handle **300ms delay**, pointer events and the click event,
11.  Fix common bugs caused by `position: fixed`, `overflow: auto` and `background-attachment`,
12.  Set up a device testing lab and test on mobile,
13.  Reconsider outdated development practices,
14.  Adjust expectations for **mobile networks** and latency.</p>

The <strong>mobile value chain</strong> involves operators, device vendors and OS vendors—all having their own interests and goals that shape the device market and complicate things for us, web developers. If you read <a href="https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/the-mobile-book-digital-edition.html">The Mobile Book</a> already, this chapter is a revised and extended version of the chapter.

There are 30 mobile browsers, ranging from lousy to great. Besides, there are also proxy browsers, default browsers, downloadable ones, confusing Android ones, and of course WebViews. What do you need to know about <strong>prevailing browsers and prevailing platforms</strong>? A comprehensive overview of the browser market, worldwide market shares and ongoing developments—and a few browser stats.</p>

With Android now spanning about three quarters of the smartphone market, it has a few <strong>problems and oddities</strong> that are uniquely its own.

<p class="desc"><span class="lead">Summary</span> <span>&bull;</span> Mobile devices have far smaller screens than desktop/laptop computers. As a result, browser vendors had to perform some sleight of hand in order to make sure desktop-optimized websites also display decently. They split the viewport, which on desktop means the browser window, into three. What are these viewports and why do we need them? By discussing <strong>pixels, viewports, resolutions</strong>, the meta viewport, media queries, and related JavaScript events and properties, you'll gain some insight into how mobile browsers (and web developers) deal with the fundamental problem of the small screen.</p>

Others may have <strong>performance issues</strong> or special interface considerations, such as <code>overflow: auto</code>. It's just about time to get to the bottom of this.</p>

At first sight, touch events seem to be roughly the same as mouse events. What are the differences? How do they work? Do we need separate events for each interaction mode, or can we merge mouse and touch into one, as Microsoft wants? It is quite likely that future new web-enabled device classes such as TVs, cars, or even fridges, will bring new <strong>interaction modes</strong> and a new set of events. How do we prepare for them? That's exactly what this chapter is all about.</p>
