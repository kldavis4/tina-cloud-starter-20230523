So here are some general guidelines, best practices and examples that will help you make sure your invoices are up to spec.</p>

### 1. Their Details and Yours

This is Mickey Mouse stuff, but you can't afford to forget it. In addition to the client's address, make sure to include the name of the client's contact person who handles your account! A company with three employees can figure out what you're doing; but in big companies, invoices get misplaced, especially if there's confusion over who belongs to which project.

You'll also need your company name, your name, address, telephone number and email address. If they have any questions about the charges, contacting you should be as easy as possible.

### 2. Itemized List of Services

People want to know what they've paid for. Most people will not pay for something described merely as "Design." Tell them <strong>exactly</strong> what they have received: e.g. "Design of three-page static website for Sporting Goods Department." Be as specific as possible. In five years, would both you and the client know what you meant by your description? Also, specify whether the charge is project-based or hourly.

### 3. Include Your Terms

When do you expect the client to pay you? What happens if they miss the deadline? To be able to send follow-up or overdue notices or to charge interest, you need a rock-solid paper trail that no one can argue with.

### 4. Let Them Know How to Pay You

Do you want a cheque mailed to you, a money transfer, flowers? <strong>Be explicitly clear about what you expect and in what form.</strong> It is usually best to discuss with the client beforehand their preferred method or to come to an agreement about a method you both like.

If you want a money transfer, provide all the necessary information. Foreign transfers need more than your account number: in some countries, you need your International Bank Account Number (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBAN">IBAN</a>) or a Bank Identifier Code (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9362">BIC</a>). International transfers also double-charge you: the client's bank might charge you $20, and your own bank might charge you another $15 to accept the payment. Make it clear which of you will absorb these charges, and talk it it out with them. PayPal is another option, but you still get charged a percentage of the transaction.

### 5. Numbers and Numbers and Records and Books

Referring to "invoice #9048," rather than "That invoice I sent you last month, I think on a Tuesday," is much easier to track for both you and your client.

Assign numbers to your invoices systematically, consistently and chronologically. Some people number their invoices by year (for example, 2009043 would be the 43rd invoice of 2009). You could also specify a code for the project. For example, BRAINEOS06 would be the 6th invoice for the braineos project that you're currently working on. Having an invoice and project numbering system keeps everything in line.

### 6. Thank Them, and Ask Them to Thank You

Money is often a touchy subject, so politeness about it is a good idea. Your clients are paying you money that they've earned with blood, sweat and tears, so let them know you appreciate it. You should also invite them to contact you if they have any questions and, more importantly, make it clear that you appreciate their present (and future) business.

Some people also welcome testimonials; for example, by adding, "Let us know how we did. Write a testimonial: info@example.com." If you're building your website's testimonials page or want to complete the feedback loop, this is a great way to get clients to give feedback on your work. If they have suggestions for making the process smoother, it's also a great opportunity for you to improve.

### 7. Don't Forget: You're a Designer

Imagine this, you're at an expensive restaurant. Every detail is perfect: the food was fantastic, the service excellent and the atmosphere rich and plush. Then, you receive the bill, which is printed on cheap paper with low-quality ink. What would you remember about this experience?

Most people spend hours on their website design, business cards and resumes but then use a template for their invoice. <strong>The invoice is your last contact with your client, and it should share the attention to detail, branding and style of your other elements.</strong> By creating a beautiful, clear invoice, you are saying that you care about the little details.

Most importantly, make sure you have all the necessary information. Make sure there are no spelling mistakes and that your spacing is consistent. Customize your invoice as much as you can. Your logo is a must, but colors and a style that match your other branding items will make it a joy to pay (well, as much as is possible).

The invoice is a boring document, and one often neglected. Andy Clarke from <a href="https://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/">Stuff and Nonsense</a> has had "fix up my invoice" on his to-do list for 10 years. This was a fairly typical response from many I had asked!

Jon Hicks lamented that, "The problem is that a lot of tools for invoicing make it quite hard to customize the template. I use <a href="https://www.billingsapp.com/">Billings</a>, which is a great app, but doing basic things like getting elements to line up require a pound of flesh!"

## Invoice Design Examples

Whether you're using invoice software or designing your invoice from scratch, creating a beautiful invoice is possible. Here are a few examples.

## Online Invoicing Roundup

Designing and tracking invoices yourself is a lot of work. A lot of online invoicing applications would save you much time and keep you organized (especially designers like me, who would lose their head if they forgot to attach one!). Hundred of online services are out there. Here, I'll review seven apps based on their ease of first time use, cost, customizability of the templates, usability and more.</p>

### [Quickbooks Online](https://oe.quickbooks.com/)

<a href="https://oe.quickbooks.com/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async"  src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7a8966fa-c625-40fd-adc8-c54de7ce85c9/quickbooks.gif" alt="quickbooks logo" /></a>

*   **Cost?** From free to $34.95 per month.
*   **Free option?** Yes, for up to 20 customers. And a free trial is available.
*   **Customized invoice design?** ![two stars](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/50eef3e4-9ab8-40d5-9343-989f0b3d6d7c/two-stars.gif) Changing the logo is a convoluted process (I ended up using Help, which detailed a six-step process to get to it), and the logo ends up only 1 square-inch. You can choose between about 13 different templates, but I didn't like any of them. You can change the font and size of various elements (such as the title), which was nice, but the placement of some of the items left a lot to be desired.
*   **Time to create a customized invoice?** The first time, I gave up in frustration. It wouldn't let me set up a UK address, so I set up a hypothetical business, an option it allowed. The second time I pretended to have a business in Beverly Hills 90210 and managed to get in. It still took me about 20 minutes to get it together, having discarded my saved invoice a few times after trying to customize it.
*   **Usability?** ![one star](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ea86cbfa-d03b-48cb-9781-d6b639afae51/one-star.gif) The landing page is okay, but the app itself is a bit crowded and disorganized. It tries to show you where quick start items are, but I felt lost. It is inconsistent too: some pages have an ugly brown header, while others had a newer design.
*   **Recurring payments/actionable late payments?** Yes/Yes. It shows a list of overdue invoices, and an automated email service has just launched.
*   **Other accounting features?** You can track everything, I'm sure, but could I find anything? Would I even want to now?

<strong>Other pros?</strong>
It's probably easy for people who are familiar with QuickBooks, because you can import existing books. It seems to solve every conceivable problem, so if you have very particular needs, this might be best for you.

<strong>Other cons?</strong>
This application immediately made me angry and frustrated. It also can't be used on Firefox on the Mac (but does work with Safari) or in any country outside the US.</p>

### [Simplify This](https://www.simplifythis.com/)

<a href="https://www.simplifythis.com/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async"  src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8634bbcf-e7fa-4a38-a158-83757805081c/simplify-this.jpg" alt="Simplify this logo" /></a>

*   **Cost?** From $9 to $29 per month.
*   **Free option?** Free trial.
*   **Customized invoice design?** ![one star](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ea86cbfa-d03b-48cb-9781-d6b639afae51/one-star.gif) You can add a logo, but I couldn't find any options for changing color or layout or even find a preview.
*   **Time to create a customized invoice?** I gave up after 25 minutes.
*   **Usability?** ![one star](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ea86cbfa-d03b-48cb-9781-d6b639afae51/one-star.gif) The logo is okay, but the spacing isn't super-clean or consistent, and I was confused by which items were associated with which accounts and how to actually generate an invoice.
*   **Recurring payments/track late payments?** Undetermined/Undetermined.
*   **Other accounting features?** Undetermined.

<strong>Other pros?</strong>
It offers a lot of interaction: e.g. each item gives you a pull-down menu, where you can edit and set as "Contacted," "Lost" and "Change to customer," but I'm unsure what any of these are for.

<strong>Other cons?</strong>
Maybe I'm not very good at this, but I couldn't figure out how to do <em>anything</em>. It shows a "How to" page before the interface; but, of course, I didn't read it, and then couldn't figure out how to get back.</p>

### [Curdbee](https://curdbee.com/)

<a href="https://curdbee.com/"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async"  src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/048e4ec2-076a-419b-ab9d-4690c32194bc/curd-bee.gif" alt="Curdbee logo" /></a>

*   **Cost?** Free, or upgrade for $5 per month.
*   **Free option?** Substantial amount of features for free.

*   **Recurring payments/actionable late payments?** Yes/Turns red, but is not actionable.

<strong>Other pros?</strong>
I was pleasantly surprised by this little app. It creates a decent invoice and does it simply. It also has strong integrations with PayPal and Google Checkout to make payments even easier! And upgrading is inexpensive.

<strong>Other cons?</strong>
You get PDF functionality only with the upgrade; but at only $5 per month, it is definitely affordable!

I couldn't figure out how to change my currency for individual clients. I might have missed it, but it wasn't immediately obvious to me.</p>

*   **Recurring payments/actionable late payments?** Yes/Not yet.
*   **Other accounting features?** Yes, you can track your business expenses here.

<strong>Other pros?</strong>
Getting started is easy because things behave as you would expect. It also integrates with 37 Signals' management tools, FreshBooks and more.

<strong>Other cons?</strong>
When I wanted to create my first invoice, a template wasn't available, so I created one, but upon returning, I found all of the information I'd entered so far for that invoice was gone! I hate re-entering data in forms (even if only for a minute).</p>

*   **Customized invoice design?** ![four stars](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a8bff947-69af-4162-b0b0-7d6c2b4ecaf6/four-stars.gif) You can add your own logo and choose between seven attractive templates. You can't change the color, but I found a template I was happy with.
*   **Time to create a customized invoice?** Took at least 10 minutes; I couldn't figure out how to get back into it because it required my bank details.
*   **Usability?** ![four stars](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a8bff947-69af-4162-b0b0-7d6c2b4ecaf6/four-stars.gif) Well designed and easy to use. Once I got around bank account entry problem, it was great.

Clear navigation and plenty of explanation for first-time users, with pull-down help bars in case you need them. You can also upload bank statements to track your invoices and expenses against your bank account. And you can customize the front page's appearance.

<strong>Other cons?</strong>
Because I was just testing this app, I didn't want to enter my bank account details. It's a great feature, but for those who don't need it or just want to play around, it's annoying.</p>

*   **Cost?** Four options, from free to $45 per month.
*   **Free option?** Yes, but you can't add a logo, and only 2 invoices, and two clients per month.
*   **Customized invoice design?** ![Two Stars in Invoice Like A Pro: Examples and Best Practices](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/50eef3e4-9ab8-40d5-9343-989f0b3d6d7c/two-stars.gif) They have the option to add a logo if you're upgraded and the choice between 5 different template styles. They are very plain though, and non-customizable. I personally don't like them at all!
*   **Time to create a customized invoice?** Five minutes.
*   **Usability?** ![Three Stars in Invoice Like A Pro: Examples and Best Practices](https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/35719c5f-081a-4bb5-9d3d-31c92633b20b/three-stars.gif) It's okay. Most things are easy enough to figure out, but they seem to have some weird ways of getting to where you want to go. Not a bad experience but not exactly drool worthy.
*   **Recurring payments/actionable late payments?** No/Not that I can see. It turns the line red if it's overdue, but there's no actionable things here.
*   **Other accounting features?** It has a punch-in system for tracking time.

<strong>Other pros</strong>
They make an effort to add helper text along the way, but I didn't notice it until 15 minutes in.

<strong>Other cons</strong>
It doesn't auto number the invoices, so you have to remember what the last invoice number you gave a project.</p>

*   **Other accounting features?** You can receive Blinksale invoices from other companies you purchase from.

<strong>Other pros</strong>
A lot of explanation for new users, and the input fields show examples of data, making it easy to see what to do next. It integrates with Basecamp and PayPal. And sent invoices can be linked to your client's own Blinksale account.

<strong>Other cons</strong>
You can't test this application without submitting your credit card details, even for the free trial. You also can't create PDFs on the "Bronze" plan (the ideal plan for part-time freelancers). Finally, it doesn't automate the numbering of your invoice IDs (although it tells you your last one).</p>
