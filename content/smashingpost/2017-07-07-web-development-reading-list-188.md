  CSS is an amazing tool which we constantly use but we don't seem to honor it
  appropriately. Whenever I see the growing browser support of the
  `:focus-within` selector, the much wanted `justify-content: space-evenly` for
  Flexbox or how great CSS Grids already work, I feel really grateful to have
  such awesome tools available to work with.

## CSS/Sass

*   The [`:focus-within` CSS pseudo-selector](https://codepen.io/matuzo/pen/awdevz) is a nice way to enhance your form sections further. [Browser support](https://caniuse.com/#search=%3Afocus-within) is still a bit limited so far but it’s already worth thinking about adding it to your code to improve design and usability for those whose browser support the selector already.
*   The CSS Flexbox Module specification now has a [new value `justify-content: space-evenly`](https://codepen.io/matuzo/pen/GmXVWo?editors=1100). This new setting places even space between and to the outer of the elements — a feature we all wanted to have very much in Flexbox. It already works in Firefox, and Safari Tech Preview and Chrome Canary have the support as well.

## Going Beyond...
