  Over the last months we released a variety of icon sets, tools and templates, but now we would like to release something a bit different for a change. In this post we are glad to release **Photoshop Keyboard Shortcuts**, a PDF-file with a handy overview of most useful keyboard shortcuts available in Adobe Photoshop.

The cheat sheet was created by Kenneth Setzer and released especially for Smashing Magazine and its readers.

The cheat sheet is a mousepad-sized image featuring a typical PC keyboard. Photoshop's keyboard shortcuts are listed for each key, with the shortcut and its icon printed on the individual key. In red is the shortcut you will get by hitting the key in combination with the Ctrl key. For example, typing <code>"t"</code> in Photoshop will activate the Type tool, while typing <code>Ctrl+t</code> will allow you to use the Transformation tool. Additional shortcuts requiring more than two keys are listed as well.

### Behind the design

As always, here are some insights from the designer herself:
<blockquote>Originally, I intended to buy a keyboard overlay with Photoshop shortcuts, but couldn't find any for a PC, just for Macs. So I compiled a list of keyboard shortcuts, and thought they would fit nicely on a mousepad. I think printing it out and hanging it by the monitor works just as well. I hope those learning Photoshop will find it useful, as well as the more advanced users who may have forgotten some of the less-often-used shortcuts. They save a lot of time, and can impress your boss!</blockquote>

Thank you very much, Kenneth! We appreciate your efforts.
