  While I was away on vacation, the web development community stayed consistent,
  and since I’ve been back, the same well-known, long-running discussions about
  JavaScript, frameworks, and progressive enhancement are full on again.

  But on the other hand, we also see **great new solutions for CSS**, simple but
  efficient JavaScript libraries, and brave people sharing their personal
  stories from which we all can learn a lot.

While I was away on vacation, the web development community stayed consistent, and since I’ve been back, the same well-known, long-running discussions about JavaScript, frameworks, and progressive enhancement are full on again. But on the other hand, we also see **great new solutions for CSS**, simple but efficient JavaScript libraries, and brave people sharing their personal stories from which we all can learn a lot.</p>

## News

*   I rarely recommend conferences here, but this free online conference might be interesting for some of you: [Sustainable UX](https://sustainableux.com/), with topics on doing meaningful, sustainable work.</p>

## Concept & Design

*   Google and Monotype created a full typeface for all the world’s written and spoken languages: [Noto](https://www.itsnicethat.com/news/google-monotype-noto-type-family-061016).

## Web Performance

*   Alex Painter wrote about [how loading JavaScript can slow down websites](https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blogs/2016/september/how-loading-javascript-can-slow-websites-down/), even if it’s asynchronous.</p>

## HTML & SVG

*   This guide to making [SVG maps with MapShaper](https://simplemaps.com/resources/guide-to-mapshaper) shows where to find geographic map resources, how to modify them, and, finally, how to export and use them as SVG.
*   Mike Riethmuller shows that [SVG has more potential](https://madebymike.com.au/writing/svg-has-more-potential/) than we tend to think and how it provides clever solutions to everyday use cases.</p>

## JavaScript

*   [Hyperform](https://hyperform.js.org/) is a complete implementation of the HTML5 form validation API in JavaScript. It replaces or polyfills the browser’s native methods and eases your validation task with custom events and hooks.</p>

## CSS/Sass

*   Heydon Pickering wrote the probably shortest and smallest CSS grid framework possible: [Fukol](https://github.com/Heydon/fukol-grids), a Flexbox grid that weighs in at only 93 bytes.
*   Matt Hinchliffe explains how [CSS grid layout will change the way we develop layouts](https://maketea.co.uk/2016/09/28/css-grid-layout-is-a-step-change.html).

## Work & Life

*   I wrote a medium-length piece on [how important it is to take proper vacation time regularly](https://helloanselm.com/2016/enough-vacation-time/) to relax your body and mind.
*   This week is Geek Mental Health Week, and I feel it’s important to listen to the stories that people who suffer from mental problems have to tell. Sarah Parmenter, for example, [shares her experience of losing her mum and her grandparents](https://www.sazzy.co.uk/geek-mental-health-week/) and how she looked for professional help to improve her situation.
*   Bastian Allgeier shares his thoughts on why you should [choose tools that fit best into a project and that you feel confident working with](https://bastianallgeier.com/notes/pressure) instead of considering frameworks and tools just because they’re cool.
*   “[Why’s that company so big? I could do that in a weekend](https://danluu.com/sounds-easy/)” is something we tend to say easily when we look at a company’s product and its team. But Dan Luu shares why we think that way and why we’re wrong.

## Going Beyond…

*   Farhad Manjoo sums up [how Mailchimp succeeded as a company](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/06/technology/mailchimp-and-the-un-silicon-valley-way-to-make-it-as-a-start-up.html) and how they built a sustainable business model without any venture capital and without following the usual start-up path.

_And with that, I’ll close for this week. If you like what I write each week, please [support me with a donation](https://wdrl.info/donate) or share this resource with other people. You can learn more [about the costs of the project here](https://wdrl.info/costs/). It’s available via email, RSS, and online._
