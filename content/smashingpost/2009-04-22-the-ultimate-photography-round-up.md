## 1\. High Speed Photography

<a href="/2008/11/02/when-time-freezes-50-beautiful-examples-of-freeze-photography/">Celebration Of High-Speed Photography</a>
This post is supposed to provide you with some inspiration of what can be done with high-speed photography. It also showcases some truly stunning slow-motion videos.

## 2\. Tilt-Shift Photography

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilt-shift_photography" rel="nofollow">Tilt-shift photography</a> refers to the use of camera movements on small- and medium-format cameras; it usually requires the use of special lenses.

Tilt-shift actually encompasses two different types of movements: rotation of the lens relative to the image plane, called tilt, and movement of the lens parallel to the image plane, called shift. Tilt is used to control the orientation of the plane of focus (PoF), and hence the part of an image that appears sharp; it makes use of the Scheimpflug principle. Shift is used to change the line of sight while avoiding the convergence of parallel lines, as when photographing tall buildings.

Another, less cost-intensive technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilt-shift_miniature_faking" rel="nofollow">tilt-shift miniature faking</a> is a process in which a photograph of a life-sized location or object is manipulated so that it looks like a photograph of a miniature-scale model.

## 5\. Infrared Photography

## 10\. RAW Processing

A raw image file contains minimally processed data from the image sensor. Raw image files are sometimes called digital negatives, because they serve the same role as negatives in film photography. But unlike negatives, these files need much more processing.

Capture One 4 is more than just a rewritten version of Phase One’s Capture One LE. It offers improved speed and quality of RAW conversion, and it builds on its strengths as a RAW-processing workflow tool.

## 11\. Panoramic Photography

A <strong>panorama</strong> — or panoramic photo — is usually made by stitching several pictures taken with the same camera into one.

<a href="https://www.photoaxe.com/how-to-panoramic-photography-part-i/" rel="nofollow">How To: Panoramic Photography</a>
Making a panoramic photo really is only taking the pictures, stitching them together on your computer. The more effort and attention you put into the first step, the easier the second step will be and the more realistic your final photo will look.

Many digital cameras, even some budget-priced pocket compacts, have a feature known as “Panorama Stitching” mode. If you haven’t experimented with it yet, it is designed to help with a particular type of photograph, or rather series of photographs, in which successive shots are taken as the camera is panned across a scene.

<a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7295" rel="nofollow">Building Panoramic Images in The GIMP</a>
Panoramic landscapes make for some amazing photos. There’s nothing like the relaxation and tranquility felt when gazing over the sweeping wilderness, save for the hassle of actually getting there. Using a digital camera, it’s possible to stitch photos together to simulate the expensive effects of a landscape filter.</p>
