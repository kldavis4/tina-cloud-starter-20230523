Web design community is strong and hard-working. We have plenty of useful resources, tools and services created, developed and released every single day: apart from goodies such as free fonts or icons, there are also many educational resources and little time-savers that can significantly improve designer’s workflow. We permanently look out for the new projects and support them by presenting them on <a href="https://twitter.com/smashingmag">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/smashmag">Facebook</a>, in our <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-smashing-newsletter/">e-mail newsletter</a> and, evidently, in Smashing Magazine’s posts.

Today we are glad to present one of such posts: an **overview of handy new resources for web designers**; most of them were released recently, but some of them are a bit older. Still, they were included to supplement the overview, making the post more comprehensive and complete. Please feel free to discuss the featured resources in the comments to this post. And, of course, thank you guys for creating and maintaining all these useful resources. Your efforts are deeply appreciated.

It also includes helpful illustrations for each example, so there’s no confusion.

When you see a ‘Submit’-button on a form, what comes to your mind? One could easily reason that clicking the button submits the user’s information into the system for processing. A ‘Submit’-button describes what the system does well, but it doesn’t describe what the user does at all. The article suggests to stop using the wording ‘Submit’ on buttons and provide more meaningful, task-specific names instead.
