We put out the call on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/smashingmag/status/999192631593795584) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/smashmag/posts/10156456205927490): “What email newsletters are you following these days?” The task of compiling your (many, many) responses has fallen to me.

I should disclose that I have a vested interest in that I currently edit a bi-weekly email newsletter for a conference organizer, UX Australia. In fact, over the years, I’ve edited dozens of email newsletters &mdash; some more successful than others.

Anyway, for the purpose of this article, we need to make a few things clear.

First, the newsletters that were most namechecked are included here in their own section: “The Favorites.” The eight that made this list comprise a formidable toolkit of newsletters for any web designer or front-end developer.

Second, I found that there are several types of newsletters which I tried to include representatively:

- Aggregated links
- Editorial
- Company/product/service/event promotions
- Tutorials
- Broad industry news
- Specific tech news
- Combination of any of the above

Third, there is a *lot* of overlap in linked content from one newsletter to the next. That’s to be expected when everyone wants to break news and aggregate link-worthy articles.

Fourth, I focused on great newsletter content. It could be presented as sophisticated HTML with videos and infographics, or it could be no nonsense plain text with minimal descriptions, as long as the content &mdash; including how reliable any links are &mdash; is good.

{{% feature-panel %}}

Lastly, I tried to keep the focus to only actual newsletters that arrive in your email inbox, and that focus on what web designers and developers do. That’s not to deny the value of newsletters that give designers and devs a broader *context* for their work; I just had to draw the line somewhere.

I also excluded newsletters that claim to be bi-weekly but have produced just four issues in the last nine months (even if those four issues were very good) and “occasional updates.”

So, let’s see what we have. Buckle up.

## Individuals

While I was compiling this article, I realized I have my own go-to set of people whose email newsletters I really look forward to. It’s not because they’re necessarily “the best” &mdash; it’s more that their choices of content, tone and focus strike a strong chord with me.

I’m sure you have your own, but here &mdash; apart from those who come up in the preceding sections &mdash; are the individuals whose newsletters I look forward to landing in my inbox.

- [Frank Chimero](https://frankchimero.com/) (design)
- [Sarah Doody](https://www.sarahdoody.com/) (UX)
- [Benedict Evans](https://www.ben-evans.com/) (web & tech)
- [Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/newsletter/) (web & tech)
- [Gerry McGovern](https://gerrymcgovern.com/) (UX)
- [Mike Monteiro](https://muledesign.com/speaking/mike-monteiro) (design & ethics)
- [Leisa Reichelt](https://www.disambiguity.com/) (UX research)

And that completes our latest round-up of email newsletters for web designers and developers.

Did I say “completes”? Of course, this list is not complete! For one thing, it probably doesn’t have your favorites. Add them &mdash; preferably with a working link &mdash; in the comments below.
