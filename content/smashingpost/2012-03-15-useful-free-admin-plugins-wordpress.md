The admin area is the heart of any WordPress-powered website. It’s where everything is controlled and where admin, editors, authors and contributors publish content to posts, pages and other custom post types. The default features of WordPress are fine for some website owners, although you may find that certain features need to be improved and others need to be added.

<img title="useful-admin-plugins" src="https://archive.smashing.media/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/aac0bce8-37fc-4a23-94c8-64d0d7af7fef/useful-admin-plugins.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="300" />

Thankfully, the core features of WordPress can easily be extended with plugins. Plugins enable you to extend only the areas you need. For example, if you have a basic blog with five authors, you might only be interested in plugins that improve your editorial process and speed up the process of articles being written, reviewed and published. Likewise, if your website allows registration, you may want to add a plugin that lets you specify what users can and cannot do.</p>

Today, we’ll show you a number of great plugins that will enhance your WordPress website in some way. These administration plugins are all free to download from the <a title="Official WordPress plugin directory" href="https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/">official WordPress plugin directory</a> and will help protect your website, give you more control over users or automate the editorial process.</p>

## Post Scheduling And Management

### 1. Editorial Calendar

This is the perfect plugin for managing the scheduling of your posts. <a title="Editorial Calendar" href="https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/editorial-calendar/">Editorial Calendar</a> adds a calendar page to the post section of your admin area. Each day shows the posts that are scheduled for that day. Multiple posts are listed in chronological order.

Using the calendar, you can quickly edit titles and publishing times and change the status of posts from “Draft” to “Pending review” to “Published” or “Scheduled.” You can change the content of posts using the “Quick edit” option, too. To change a post’s date, all you have to do is drag and drop the article to another day, and the date stamp will be automatically updated. Useful for those of you who schedule a lot of articles in advance.

### 2. Peter’s Collaboration E-mails

A great plugin for managing the editorial flow of posts. When a contributor submits a post for review, the plugin emails the specified users to let them know there is a post to review. Once the post is approved, the contributor gets an email letting them know it has been accepted. If the post is changed back to “Draft,” the contributor is advised that it has not been accepted and is sent a link to edit the article.

Content Audit enables you and your staff to easily review old content and determine if it’s still relevant. The plugin works with posts, pages and media. You can automatically set content as outdated after a set period of time and notify post authors about it. Content can be marked as redundant, outdated or trivial.

It comes packaged with a calendar for scheduling posts more easily, custom statuses to define the exact stage a post or page is at, threaded commenting between authors and editors, editorial meta data and notifications to let authors and editors know about the status of a post or page.

It also features user groups to help you manage your staff better, and a story budget that highlights upcoming content.

For example, the video tab only has a field for the video’s title and a text area to post the video’s code. Don’t be surprised if you see this built into WordPress’s core in 2012.

It can also change some settings directly, such as the table prefix of your database and the default admin user name (which is “admin”).

It can also hide the version of WordPress you are using, and it walks you through why adding an <code>.htaccess</code> file to the <code>wp-admin</code> folder will make the website more secure.

One of the most popular role capabilities plugins for WordPress. User Role Editor lets you change the capabilities of each user group. This is useful for restricting what certain user groups can do or for giving them additional responsibilities (for example, by default contributors aren’t allowed to upload images).

## Database Management

### 25\. Portable phpMyAdmin

Portable phpMyAdmin lets you access phpMyAdmin directly through the admin area. You don’t need to enter any log-in details, making it a quicker way to manage your database than logging into your host’s control panel. Very useful.

Another great security plugin from Website Defender for improving the security of your WordPress-powered website. It provides information on how to make your website more secure in a number of areas, such as making sure important files and directories have the right settings. It can also change some settings directly, such as the table prefix of your database and the default admin user name (which is “admin”).

It can also hide the version of WordPress you are using, and it walks you through why adding an <code>.htaccess</code> file to the <code>wp-admin</code> folder will make the website more secure.

### 20\. User Spam Remover

Useful for anyone who has had a problem with registration spam. The plugin automatically deletes spam registrations and accounts that have never been used.

### 22\. User Role Editor

One of the most popular role capabilities plugins for WordPress. User Role Editor lets you change the capabilities of each user group. This is useful for restricting what certain user groups can do or for giving them additional responsibilities (for example, by default contributors aren’t allowed to upload images). You can also override the capabilities defined for user groups and change the capabilities of users individually.

## Speed And Performance

### 29\. W3 Total Cache

Recommended by most hosting companies and used by many large blogs, <a title="W3 Total Cache" href="https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/">W3 Total Cache</a> is one of the best ways to cache your pages and speed the performance of your website. It works well with content delivery networks such as MaxCDN, too.

A popular caching plugin that serves static HTML files to the majority of your users. It’s a lot easier to set up than W3 Total Cache, in part due to the option to simply enable caching and use the default settings.

## Summary

The great thing about WordPress is that the default installation doesn’t overwhelm you with options (although some would prefer it to be even simpler). This approach allows us to choose the plugins that contribute to our particular needs and disregard those that don’t.

You might find that some of these plugins can be disabled after you use them. For example, after using <a title="User Spam Remover" href="https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/user-spam-remover/">User Spam Remover</a> I disabled registration on my website, so I no longer need it. Likewise, I activate Portable phpMyAdmin only when I need to modify my database, and thus it is deactivated most of the time. I recommend reviewing your situation every month or so and remove any plugins that aren’t being used regularly.

I hope you’ve enjoyed this list of useful admin plugins. If your favourite admin plugin didn’t make the list, please feel free to share it with other Smashing Magazine readers in the comments area.
