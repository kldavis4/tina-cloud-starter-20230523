How do we build and establish a successful design system? What about modern CSS and JavaScript? What‚Äôs the state of HTML Email? And what are new, smart design patterns we could use? What will it take us to move to TypeScript or Vue.js? With our line-up of online workshops, we try to answer these questions well. 

Our workshops bring in knowledgeable, kind folks from the community to explore **real-life solutions** to real-life problems, live, with you. All sessions are broken down into **2.5h-segments** across days, so you always have time to ask questions, share your screen and get immediate feedback.

In fact, [live discussions and interactive exercises](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/10/how-we-run-smashing-online-workshops/) are at the very heart of every workshop, with group work, homework, reviews and live interaction with people around the world. Plus, you get all **video recordings** of all sessions, so you can re-watch at any time, in your comfy chair in familiar comfort of your workspace.

## What Are Online Workshops Like?

Do you experience **Zoom fatigue** as well? After all, who really wants to spend more time in front of their screen? That‚Äôs exactly why we‚Äôve [designed the online workshop experience from scratch](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/10/how-we-run-smashing-online-workshops/), accounting for the time needed to take in all the content, understand it and have enough time to ask *just* the right questions.

<figcaption>In <a href="https://smashingconf.com/online-workshops/">our workshops</a>, everybody is just a slightly blurry rectangle on the screen; everybody is equal, and invited to participate.</figcaption>
</figure>

Our online workshops take place **live** and span **multiple days across weeks.** They are split into 2.5h-sessions, and in every session there is always enough time to bring up your questions or just get a cup of tea. We don‚Äôt rush through the content, but instead try to create a welcoming, friendly and inclusive environment for everyone to have time to think, discuss and get feedback.

There are plenty of [things to expect from a Smashing workshop](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/02/smashing-workshop-form-design-masterclass/), but the most important one is focus on **practical examples** and techniques. The workshops aren‚Äôt talks; they are **interactive**, with live conversations with attendees, sometimes with challenges, homework and team work.

Of course, you get all workshop materials and **video recordings** as well, so if you miss a session you can re-watch it the same day.

### TL;DR

- Workshops span **multiple days**, split in *2.5h-sessions*.
- Enough time for live Q&A every day.
- Dozens of **practical examples** and techniques.
