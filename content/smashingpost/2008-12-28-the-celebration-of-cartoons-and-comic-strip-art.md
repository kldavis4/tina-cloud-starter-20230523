  many comics written with adults in mind, and this is reflected in the depth
  and scope of the artwork. Comic strips are widely read around the world in

<strong>Comics</strong> aren't just for children, as some people might think. There are many comics written with adults in mind, and this is reflected in the depth and scope of the artwork. Comic strips are widely read around the world in newspapers, magazines, books and the internet.

Comic strips have a surprisingly long and interesting history. For instance, there's evidence of comics in China from as long ago as the 11th century BC! Comics have evolved over the years with advances in technology and the changing styles of art and graphic design, and are often at the cutting edge of design.

The culture of an artist's country is often a big influence on their work, and consequently comic styles are different around the world. We present you <strong>over 50 examples of beautiful comic strip artwork</strong>, from places as diverse as America, Europe, Asia and Latin America. Some interesting articles and resources are listed at the bottom of the post.</p>

## Resources

Comics have been a large part of popular culture for generations. Growing over the ages through contributions to the genre from Christophe ChaboutÃ©, Angelo Agostini and, of course, Richard Outcault, this then-revolutionary new way for artists to create and deliver a narrative exploded throughout the art world, leaving a lasting mark that would mature over the years, morphing into a mainstream artistic medium. Today, with a more stylized focus on heroic tales and dark worlds beyond the imagination, this genre continuously churns out amazing artwork from some extremely talented artists.
