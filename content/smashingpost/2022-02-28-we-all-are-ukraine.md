This is not a regular Smashing article. But these aren‚Äôt regular times either.

I was born and grew up in Minsk, Belarus. That‚Äôs where I spent nights playing *Prince of Persia*. That‚Äôs where I‚Äôd wait in front of a bakery nearby for the smell of freshly basked *Narochansky bread*. That‚Äôs also the place where our family went to peaceful protests on the streets, even then back in the 90s heavily suppressed by an armed regime with a brutal force.

I was surrounded by incredible friends from all over. Nobody cared if it was Belarus, Ukraine or Russia, or any other friendly countries in the world. We didn‚Äôt have much, but what we did have, we valued enormously. From the collections of wrapping paper of chocolates to huge snowballs we were building all together when it was freezing outside. I remember us reading dictionaries and encyclopedias together, discussing books in book clubs, playing hockey outside, dreaming about the bright future while looking at the sky, together.

**Today, people in Ukraine can‚Äôt do that**. I‚Äôve been dozens of times in Ukraine, and I have very close friends in this wonderful country &mdash; incredibly kind and passionate people who want nothing but a better world for their families and the people around them. Some of us here at Smashing have Ukrainian origins, and we have close connections to our Ukrainian friends and colleagues.

What‚Äôs happening right now in Ukraine is **deeply personal** to all of us. It‚Äôs shocking and horrifying to see the streets of Ukraine being shelled, civil homes being bombed, people hiding in shelters, people leaving their homes, families torn apart. It‚Äôs unimaginable to realize that it‚Äôs happening right here, in the heart of Europe, right now.

I strongly believe that there are wonderful people *everywhere* in the world, and I truly believe that most people are good and kind and supportive and empathetic. And I won‚Äôt believe for a moment that any reasonable, decent and honest person can support the actions happening today.

As a design community, we all can‚Äôt be silent in these times. We need to be united in our fight against the war, for democracy, for those dreams that children are entitled to have when they are growing up. It‚Äôs our obligation to help as much as we can. This should be personal to all of us. **And Ukraine needs our help, now.**

## How Can You Help?

Everybody can make a huge difference:

- **As a merchant, set up a product and donate funds to Ukraine.**  
If you run a store, set up a product and allow people to set their own price, then donate funds to Ukraine. A point in case: [BackStage Roasters](https://backstageroasters.com/) from Lithuania, selling coffee at ‚Äúyou-pay-what-you-want‚Äù price, with all collected funds going to Ukraine. Here are [some ways to donate](https://twitter.com/vlsdllv/status/1496712056275361795).
- **Speak up in your company and organization to support Ukraine.**  
Speak in your Slack channels about what your company and organization can do to help Ukraine today. Think about campaigns you could launch to collect funds or donate money.
- **Publish posts showcasing organizations and companies supporting Ukraine.**  
Let the voice of the kind people helping out be heard; share the stories of how companies help in these times and share on social media. A great example is [Wix.com](https://twitter.com/Avishai_ab/status/1497263777833578497), with team members driving all the way to the border of Poland-Ukraine, and along with the Polish team helping the Ukrainian co-workers and their families across the border and bring them to safety.
- **Support Ukrainian refugees in your city or country.**  
Talk to people around and find out what is needed and donate clothing, shelter, old phones, or anything else that might be of help.
- **Support your Ukrainian friends, loud and clear**.  
Make your position clear. Ask your Ukrainian friends and colleagues what they need, and what you can do to help.
- **As a VPN service provider, create special plans for Russian people.**  
As social media are being blocked and censored in Russia, we need to help Russian people learn the truth about what‚Äôs happening in Ukraine today. You could also write posts explaining how to set up a VPN or use Telegram proxies in Russian.
