Well-documented and readable source code is essential for every collaborative project. Logically structured, well organized and nicely formatted, the code can <strong>speed up the bug hunting</strong> and help to keep the code clean, minimal and still functional. These aspects are particularly important if the code is being developed by a group of developers: in this context a common scheme for source code presentation is necessary. <strong>You don't have to do everything by hand;</strong> in fact, there are many tools which can save a lot of time - for you and your co-workers. 

The tools and services we've collected below aren't validators. They format and beautify the code; some of them can remove redundant elements. Using them, you have to make sure you have a backup, so your data can always be restored.

## Code Beautifier And Formatter

1.  [Quick Highlighter](https://quickhighlighter.com/)

1.  [PrettyPrinter](https://www.prettyprinter.de/)

Knows PHP, Java, C++, C, Perl, JavaScript, CSS. The service offers many formatting options you can use to present the code just the way you'd like it to look like.

1.  [Ruby Script Beautifier](https://www.arachnoid.com/ruby/rubyBeautifier.html)

Ruby Beautifier accepts a command-line list of file names, creates a backup copy of each named file and beautifies the originals. If there is an indentation error (an imbalance of opening and closing keywords), the script will print an error message but will save the result anyway.

1.  [Tabifier](https://tools.arantius.com/tabifier)

The tabifier is a tool to properly indent computer code. The style it produces is a mix of my personal preferences for indentation plus what I could manage to make a program produce from dirty source. The tabifier currently supports CSS, HTML, and C Style code; the latter being anything that uses curly braces to start and end blocks, and semicolons to terminate statements.

1.  [Highlight.js](https://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/)

Highlight.js highlights syntax in code examples on blogs, forums and in fact on any web pages.

Suported languages: Python, Ruby, Perl, PHP, HTML, CSS, Django, JavaScript, VBScript, Delphi, Java, C++, SQL. Similar tools is offered by Google: Googles Javascript Code Prettifier.
