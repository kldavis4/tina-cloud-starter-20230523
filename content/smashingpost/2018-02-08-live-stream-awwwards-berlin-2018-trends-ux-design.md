<p>Designing the best experience is a challenge, and every designer and developer has their own way of tackling it. But, well, no matter how different our approaches are, one thing is for sure: We can learn a lot from each other.</p>

## SmashingConf UX And Design Talk Highlights

<p>Not enough for you yet? To make the learning continue after the live stream has ended, how about one of these recent SmashingConf talks? Enjoy!</p>

### Cheating The UX When There Is Nothing More To Optimize

<p>You have optimized every line of code of your site/mobile application, used all the techniques at your disposal to have the fastest loading time possible. Yet, users still complain about the slowness. Let’s learn to use different design techniques and UX to work performance also at the level of user perception.</p>

### How To Design With Science Without Losing The Magic

<p>We've all had that experience, that feeling when we poured our heart and soul into some UX or design work only for it to be not taken seriously, criticised or worse, ignored. How telling stories, understanding business, talking data & numbers and psychology can all be used together to get good design done. All the time making sure we don't loose that magic inherent in great design. We'll look at approaches to plan, advocate and explain your ideas and design with confidence to get buy-in from the project team or client to ensure the user experience is the best it can be.</p>

### Once More, With Feeling

<p>What you don’t know can’t hurt you, at least that’s the old saying. But on the web, it is precisely the things that you don’t know and can’t see that can cause the biggest headaches. The web is an unstable and unpredictable environment and every day there are complications that go unnoticed and unseen — but not by the people trying to use your site. Building a stable, usable experience online requires that we broaden our perspective.</p>

### Harnessing the Creative Mind

<p>Creativity, whether it is about artistic or problem solving, is the result of learning to skillfully use the resources we have at our disposal. One such resource is how our minds process information and the world around us. Though creativity is not exclusively about problem-solving, understanding how the mind sustains our creative process facilitates and strengthens the ability to problem solve.</p>

### Redesign Design

<p>This talk, based on real-life experiences, explores how design is changing in the digital age, beyond the initial delivery of specifications and blueprints, to an adaptive co-creation process that evolves iteratively over time. This emergent idea of designOps is dissolving the boundaries between planning, discovery, building, and operating phases, leading to results that are more in tune with the true needs of users.</p>
