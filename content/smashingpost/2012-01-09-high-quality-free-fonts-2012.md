If you are passionate about typography and have fun experimenting with glyphs, then you will certainly like the rather unusual type-design game created by the interaction designer Mark MacKay. The idea of this JavaScript-based letter-shaping game is simple: you get 10 modified letters from various classic typefaces, and you have to try to make them right by dragging curves along their axes. It’s an engaging way to explore what makes or breaks a glyph.

<a href="https://font-bot.com/">Font-Bot Project</a>
It is time for your favorite font to stand its ground. The idea is to build robots out of a type face, showcase them and hope others put together a potential opponent. Once there are two font-bots ready to compete against each other, only thing left would be to "let the battle begin!" Participating is not hard, the rules are clear: all robots must be built of type alone (letters A to Z). Let's see if your font has what it takes to defend its corner. Fight!
